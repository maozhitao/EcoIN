The first 23 aa of YaaX are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. ypeC and yaaX are paralogs. The C-terminal half of YaaX is His- and Pro-rich, including five prolines in a row.
b0006	EG10011	yaaA	peroxide resistance protein, lowers intracellular iron	Null	Peroxide resistance protein, lowers intracellular iron	Mutants of yaaA in an Hpx- background (katE katG ahpCF) grow poorly, have extensive DNA damage and are filamentous; these phenotypes are due to elevated unincorporated intracellular iron levels that are suppressible by iron chelators (Liu, 2011). Although previous microarray results demonstrated a 4-fold elevation of yaaA expression by hydrogen peroxide in an oxyR mutant, this activation could not be reproduced with LacZ fusions or real time PCR (Zheng, 2001; Liu, 2011).

b0011	EG14340	yaaW	UPF0174 family protein	Putative enzyme; Not classified	UPF0174 family protein; mutation increases biofilm formation	yaaW orthologs are present in many bacterial genomes and yaaW is the second gene in the putative yaaIW operon. An ORF antisense to yaaW, referred to as htgA or htpY, has been described as having a high temperature survival function and as being subject to heat-induced gene expression (Dean, 1991; James, 1993; Missiakas, 1993). Evidence supporting the expression of the putative antisense ORF htgA(htpY) in vivo has been presented, although this has never been reproduced (Missiakas, 1993). A yaaW/htgA deletion mutant displays 3-fold increased biofilm production (Domka, 2007). Although there may be an asRNA on the opposite strand of yaaW (asRNA-yaaW), its functional relevance should not be assumed. A comprehensive characterization of the E. coli K-12 heat shock response found no evidence supporting heat shock-induction or RpoH-dependent in vitro transcription of the proposed htgA(htpY) gene (Nonaka, 2006). The antisense ORF opposing yaaW is not conserved and has an unusual amino acid composition. Long antisense ORFs occur often in the E. coli K-12 genome and are not considered to be likely protein-coding genes (Borodovsky, 1994). Skepticism is warranted when predicting long overlapping protein-coding genes in the E. coli K-12 genome as not a single case has yet been proven; actual translation should be experimentally demonstrated unequivocally. GFP transcriptional fusions to both yaaW and asRNA-yaaW were active; 5'-RACE was used to map the yaaW and asRNA-yaaW transcription start points (Fellner, 2013). The asRNA-yaaW ORF was proposed to be a functional protein-coding gene, but attempts to demonstrate production of an asRNA-encoded protein failed (Fellner, 2013). Nonsense mutations were specifically introduced, but not DNA sequence-confirmed, into the asRNA-yaaW ORF (referred to as mbiA) and yaaW in a manner preserving the amino acid sequences encoded in the opposite strand; slightly increased biofilm production was reported for both mutants, however no nonsense suppression or trans-complementation experiments were described, leaving reasonable doubt about the conclusion that the asRNA-yaaW ORF encodes a protein product (Fellner, 2013). yaaW-asRNA transcription has been detected in various microarray studies and appears to be subject to transcriptional regulation different than that of yaaW, but microarray data does not provide evidence for the translation of mbiA into a protein. A conclusive experimental demonstration of asRNA-yaaW translation has not yet been published that would warrant annotating the putative asRNA-YaaW ORF as a functional protein-coding gene.

DnaK mediates ATP-regulated binding and release of polypeptide substrates. Binds Zn(II). DnaJ is a co-chaperone for DnaK. Role in the initiation of DNA replication. DnaK has secondary amide peptide bond cis-trans isomerase (APIase) activity. A dnaK mutant is inviable above 42C, or below 8C (as enabled by transgenic Oleispira antarctica Cpn10/60). A tig dnaK double deletion is a synthetic lethal combination at 30 degrees C, however, no lethal effects are observed at 23 degrees C; overproduction of GroEL/GroES at 30 degrees C suppresses synthetic lethality. dnaK, hscA, hscC and yegD are paralogs. After four hours of Zn(II) stress, protein levels increased (Easton, 2006). DnaK lysines K70, K245, K246, K304, K359, K502, K528 and K587 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011). DnaK lysines K109, K245, K304, K421, K556 and K577 can be modified to N6-acetyllysine (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2009). HT_Cmplx22_Cyt: DnaK+GrpE+GyrA+RpsA. HT_Cmplx30_Mem: ClpB+DnaK+InfB+RpsA.

RibF is homologous to and can substitute for the essential B. subtilis RibC. RibF is also known as protein X. The biochemical characterization of RibF described in Kitatsuji, K., S. Ishino, S. Teshiba, and M. Arimoto, 1993, Process for producing flavine nucleotides, European patent application: 0 542 240 A2. Although ribF is classified as an essential gene because a kan cassette replacement deletion could not be recombineered as part of the Keio collection, using pKO-mediated knockout technology a deletion was reportedly obtained (Arigoni, 1998). Perhaps a Keio collection kan replacement mutation could not be constructed in ribF due to polarity on the downstream essential genes ileS and lsp.

The ileS mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of ileS in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). The entire protein sequence of IleS has been determined using peptide mapping by MALDI mass spectrometry; 9 aa differences were found as compared to the current DNA-derived protein sequence (300-EL>DV-301; 724G>V;738-AKADSV>PKRTVW-743); whereas the minor differences could be strain polymorphisms, the 6 aa difference may indicate two (in-and-out) closely-spaced DNA sequencing frameshift errors (Baouz, 2009).

The outer membrane of an lptD(imp) mutant is permeable to large maltodextrins and sensitive to antibiotics and detergents (Sampson, 1989, Eggert, 2001). lptD is stress induced. lptD is paralogous to lptA. The lptD(imp) gene encodes an essential outer membrane protein (Braun, 2002, Wu, 2006). A deletion mutant of lptD is non-viable (Baba, 2006).

RapA(HepA) has sequence similarity to SWI2/SNF2 helicases and binds nucleic acids, but RapA does not display RNA or DNA helicase activity in vitro (Sukhodolets, 1998). RapA has RNAP-dependent ATPase activity (Sukhodolets, 2000). rapA is downstream of polB, but is not under lexA control. The mutant phentypes may be indirect since other genes, e.g. yeeZ and aaeA(yhcQ), are downregulated in rapA(hepA) mutants (Lynch, 2007). rapA(hepA) mutant biofilms have less polysaccharide and are antibiotic sensitive (Lynch, 2007). rapA(hepA) mutants are UV sensitive.

DedA superfamily proteins YqjA and YghB likely have redundant functions since only a double mutant has defects; DedA superfamily members yabI or yohD can complement the yqjA yghB double mutant when overproduced, but a dedA clone cannot complement (Thompkins, 2008). The E. coli K-12 DedA superfamily (SNARE associated Golgi protein/PF09335) has eight paralogs in two families, the COG0586 DedA/YghB family (including the DedA/YabI/YohD subfamily and the general envelope maintenance protein YghB/YqjA subfamily) and the YdjX family (including the COG0398 YdjX/YdjZ subfamily and the COG1238 YqaA subfamily) (Doerrler, 2013; K.E.R.).

Salmonella thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate uptake has been assayed directly and is dependent on the thiBPQ operon (Webb, 1998). Although thiamine monophosphate uptake has not been assayed directly, thiamine monophosphate import by ThiBPQ may occur since the ThiB periplasmic binding protein binds thiamine, thiamine monophosphate, and thiamine pyrophosphate (Hollenbach, 2002a). Thiamine, thiamine monophosphate and thiamine pyrophosphate can feed a thiamine auxotroph, indicating all three compounds can be imported (Nakayama, 1972). Biosynthesized thiamine monophosphate is converted to the cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate by thiamine monophosphate kinase (ThiL); imported thiamine is converted to thiamine monophosphate by the salvage enzyme thiamine kinase (ThiK) (Nakayama, 1972; Melnick, 2004). thiBPQ operon expression is controlled by a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) responsive riboswitch in the 128 nt 5' UTRl the THI element 5' UTR has been reported in intergenic sRNA searches as sroA/tpe79; attenuation of transcription at the TPP-bound riboswitch produces the 93 nt sroA sRNA, ending at 75608. The experimentally determined RNA start for sroA is the start of the thiBPQ mRNA (Vogel, 2003). sroA is not annotated as a separate gene and the sroA transcript is part of the thiBPQ mRNA. The thiB riboswitch is the target for the antibiotic pyrithiamine.

Although thiamine monophosphate uptake has not been assayed directly, thiamine monophosphate import by ThiBPQ may occur since the ThiB periplasmic binding protein binds thiamine, thiamine monophosphate, and thiamine pyrophosphate (Hollenbach, 2002a). Thiamine, thiamine monophosphate and thiamine pyrophosphate can feed a thiamine auxotroph, indicating all three compounds can be imported (Nakayama, 1972). Biosynthesized thiamine monophosphate is converted to the cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate by thiamine monophosphate kinase (ThiL); imported thiamine is converted to thiamine monophosphate by the salvage enzyme thiamine kinase (ThiK) (Nakayama, 1972; Melnick, 2004). thiBPQ operon expression is controlled by a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) responsive riboswitch in the 128 nt 5' UTRl the THI element 5' UTR has been reported in intergenic sRNA searches as sroA/tpe79; attenuation of transcription at the TPP-bound riboswitch produces the 93 nt sroA sRNA, ending at 75608. The experimentally determined RNA start for sroA is the start of the thiBPQ mRNA (Vogel, 2003). sroA is not annotated as a separate gene and the sroA transcript is part of the thiBPQ mRNA. The thiB riboswitch is the target for the antibiotic pyrithiamine.

LeuO is required for recovery of a relA1 strain from starvation for brached-chain amino acids. In Salmonella, LeuO relieves leuABCD silencing mediated by an AT-rich silencer sequence between leuO and leuA. In Salmonella, LeuO expression is activated by an ilvHI-leuO-leuA promoter relay mechanism mediated by DNA supercoiling, possibly explaining the ppGpp-dependent increase in E. coli LeuO expression in stationary phase as an indirect effect of ppGpp stimulating the expression of Lrp, an ilvHI activator.

In addition to the ACT-like domain, also found in acetolactate synthase small regulatory subunit proteins IlvM and IlvN, IlvH has an additional C-terminal tandem ferridoxin domain of unknown function (Mendel, 2003; Kaplun, 2006). The stoichiometry of the acetolactate synthase 3 holoenzyme is IlvI(2)IlvH(2), a dimer of dimers. The valine binding site is probably at the interface of the two IlvH subunits (Kaplun, 2006).

RsmH(MraW) was reported to also methylate membrane proteins (Carrion, 1999). At least four groups have deleted rsmH(mraW,yabC): Carrion(1999) found it to be essential for growth; Arigoni(1998) found a reduced growth rate; Dassain(1999) and Merlin(2002) found that the deletion strain grew normally. A possible explanation is that the Carrion et al. mutation might be polar on a downstream essential gene. But this defect would have to be suppressible by RsmH(MraW) overexpression. Carrion(1999) found some protein starting with the second Met which might represent an alternative initiation site. Limiting MAP, when RsmH(MraW) is overproduced, is probably not the explanation since MM- is not a MAP substrate.

Overproduced FtsW but not overproduced MurJ increases lipid II translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane in crude reconstituted vesicles (Mohammadi, 2011). Both FtsW and MurJ are involved in lipid II translocation but which one is the actual flippase is controversial with conflicting in vivo and in vitro results; the in vitro results utilize crude membrane vesicles that also contain MurJ, which may not be limiting; the in vivo results do not demonstrate flippase activity directly and FtsW inactivation could be incomplete, so one of the two proteins could be stimulating the other which has the flippase activity; MurJ is related to known flippase exporters and FtsW is not, suggesting that MurJ may indeed be the actual flippase (Young, 2014). FtsW faciltates septal petidoglycan synthesis by recruiting the cognate FtsI transpeptidase. FtsW is required for mrdA(PBP2) expression. ftsW is paralogous to mrdB(rodA). ftsW is an essential gene.

Although FtsQ co-precipitates with FtsL and FtsB, it does not require the presence of FtsLB for mid-cell localization. FtsQ is a single transmembrane helix inner membrane protein; the 25 N-terminal aa are in cytoplasm; the last 225 aa are in periplasm. FtsQ is an essential gene. FtsQ is localized to septum by its periplasmic domain. FtsQ is targeted by SRP/FtsY to Sec/YidC for membrane insertion. FtsQ is divisome protein. blr is a multi-copy suppressor of ftsQ1(Ts), obviating the need for salt-suppression of ftsQ1; blr mutations exacerbate the ftsQ1(Ts) phenotype (Karimova, 2012).

ZapA(YgfE) binding promotes FtsZ polymer bundling and inhibits the GTPase activity of FtsZ (Small, 2007). ZapC binding promotes FtsZ polymer bundling (lateral interactions) and inhibits the GTPase activity of FtsZ (Hale, 2011; Durand-Heredia, 2011). Overexpression of ZapC causes filamentation and aberrant FtsZ filaments (Hale, 2011; Durand-Heredia, 2011). FtsZ is stored in a dynamic helical FtsZ cytoskeleton upon disassembly of the Z ring in daughter cells. Overexpression causes filamentous biofilm formation. Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004).

SecA binds and targets preprotein-secB complexes to the secYEG membrane-imbedded translocon, and is the translocase ATPase subunit driving proteins through the inner membrane. SecA targets protein precursors to the SecYE core translocon for secretion. The SecA helicase activity is dispensable for both functions.

The coaE is essential for growth as tested by genetic footprinting (Hare, 2001). The N-terminus of a recombinant CoaE protein was sequenced but this is not verification for the start codon of fMet cleavage since plasmid gene expression was forced at the ATG and an Ala was added during cloning between the fMet and the second Arg residue (Mishra, 2001).

During oxidative stress inactive AcnB apo-enzyme without iron sulphur clusters binds the acnB mRNA 3' UTR, stabilizes acnB mRNA and increases AcnB synthesis, thus mediating a post-transcriptional positive autoregulatory switch (Tang, 1999). AcnB contains a 4Fe-4S cluster that requires either IscA or SufA for proper assembly (Tan, 2009).

PanD is autocleaved into two subunits; the N-terminal serine of the mature PanD alpha subunit is modified to pyruvic acid and involved in catalysis (van Poelje, 1990; Ramjee, 1997; Albert, 1998; Schmitzberger, 2003). Genetically replacing the modified Ser25 with an alanine inactivates PanD (Kennedy, 2004). Monomeric PanM binds to tetrameric PanD and accelerates PanD self-activation by autocleavage at Ser25 in vivo and in vitro; plasmid overexpression of panD overcomes the pantothentate requirement of panM mutants; PanM(PanZ) was initially characterized in Salmonella and subsequently characterized in E. coli (Stuecker, 2012a; Stuecker, 2012b; Nozaki, 2012).

PcnB can polyadenylate many mRNAs and it is proposed that Rho-independent transcription terminators serve as polyadenylation signals (Mohanty, 2006). The first 10 amino acids of PcnB are processed off by an unknown protease (Cao, 1992). RssB(SprE) is required to maintain the association of PcnB with the degradosome during stationary phase (Carabetta, 2010).

High copy dksA suppresses mukB and TS growth and filamentation of a dnaK mutant. dksA is also a multicopy suppressor of dnaJ, grpE and prc. dksA transcription is alkali-inducible. dksA mutations affect chromosomal supercoiling. Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). HT_Cmplx24_Cyt: DksA+GreA. dksA and ybiI are paralogs.

The LpoB-PBP1B complex may contribute to OM constriction during cell division (Typas, 2010). MrcB is part of a complex with MltA and MipA. The N-terminal transglycosylase activity polymerizes the glycan backbone and is penicillin-insensitive. The C-terminal transpeptidase activity crosslinks the muramic peptides and is penicillin-sensitive. Full length MrcB is the alpha isoform. A second in vivo ATG start at codon 46 produces the 799 aa gamma isoform. Murein polymerase is an essential function satisfied by either MrcA or MrcB. Mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006). MrcB is a membrane-bound periplasmic enzyme that has two membrane association sites: hydropathic residues 64-87 and a region somewhere between residues 88 and 250 that is not apparent in hydropathy plots (Edelman, 1987; Wang, 1996).

Verified Tat substrate: FhuD has a predicted Tat-only (Class I) 30 aa signal peptide (Tullman-Ercek, 2007). The N-terminal sequence in Rohrback (1995), cited in UniProtKB, does not verify this putative SPI cleavage; it is the product of an enterokinase cleavage of a cloning construct. Rohrback (1995) demonstrated proper folding of FhuD in the cytoplasm prior to export, consistent with FhuD needing the Tat pathway, which exports folded proteins.

Autocleavage of DegP causes hexameric DegP(HtrA) to dissociate into proteolytically active monomers. DegP is targeted to some proteins by CpxP. Sigma E promoter. degP mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006). DegP(HtrA) has chaperone activity in vitro as demonstrated by efficient inhibition of the unfolded lysozyme aggregation (Skorko-Glonek, 2007). DegP is associated with outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and is required for the degradation of unfolded OMPs; DegP(HtrA) has very little chaperone activity in cells (Ge, 2013).

The only known substrates for GlnD are the two PII proteins GlnB and GlnK. In both cases GlnD covalently modifies residue Tyr51 in the T-loop of the substrate thereby controlling the ability of GlnB and GlnK to interact with their specific targets. The activity of GlnD is controlled by the intracellular glutamine availability. Glutamine inhibits the transferase action of GlnD and as a consequence GlnB and GlnK are deuridylylated in N-sufficient conditions. [Comment provided by EcoTeam member Mike Merrick, 11.16.06]

RpoE regulon. RseP activates RpoE and releases membrane-bound RseA-RpoE complexes. Cleavage occurs around RseA membrane domain generating the N-terminal and the soluable product. rseP is an essential gene, but deletion of ompCF or ompCA (or an sRNA rseX clone, which suppresses ompCA translation) allows growth. RseP or some other protease degrades RseA in the released complexes. The RseA periplasmic domain must be first clipped or degraded by DegS before it is a substrate for RseP. RseP is related to the E. faecalis Eep protein involved in bacterial regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). RseP has been topology mapped using protein fusions. RseP is reported to degrade RpoE and RpoH in vitro and to be an negative, not positive, effector of RpoE action in vivo, but the physiological relevance and/or accuracy of this has subsequently been strongly challenged (Dartigalongue, 2001).

Published transduction mapping results were used to locate the tsaA1 mutation to yaeB, which encodes the only predicted methyltransferase near tsaA1 (K. Rudd, 2011, unpublished). The crystal structure of the TsaA(YaeB) ortholog AF0241 from A. fulgidus has a bound SAM molecule leading to the prediction that TsaA(YaeB) is a novel methyltransferase (Forouhar, 2007). The crystal structure of the TsaA(YaeB) ortholog RPA0152 from R. palustris has a bound SAM molecule (Chang, C.,?Evdokimova, E.,?Liu, F.,?Savchenko, A.,?Edwards, A.,?Joachimiak, A., unpublished). Threonine tRNA(GGU) 1 (ThrV) modified to t(6)A37 (ThrV) is also methylated to form m(6)t(6)A37 (Komine, 1992). Threonine tRNA(GGU) 3 (ThrT) modified to t(6)A37 is also methylated to form m(6)t(6)A37 (Clarke, 1974). TsaA(YaeB) is a member of the UPF0066 family. otherPDB(R.palustris): 3OKX. otherPDB(A.fulgidus): 2NV4. The m(6)t(6)A37 modified tRNA nucleotide may be derived from a labile cyclized m(6)ct(6)A37 during extraction (Miyauchi, 2013).

MltD can be modified by lysine acetylation in vitro using purified E. coli Pka(YfiQ) (Thao, 2010). MltD has been shown to be a murein hydrolase using zymography, to cause lysis or osmotically-stabilized spheroplasts when overproduced, and to be inhibited by bulgecin (Dijkstra A.J., Rudd, K.E., and Keck, W., A new member of the transglycosylase family of Escherichia coli displays a Gram-positive hydrolase motif, in "The soluble lytic transglycolsylase family of Escherichia coli", A.J. Dijkstra, pp. 85-101, Ph.D. thesis, University of Groningen, the Netherlands, 1997). MltD has two Gram-positive peptidoglycan-binding motifs in the C-terminus. MltD has a central lysozyme-like domain. MltD should cleave the glycosidic bonds between the N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in murein. The first 15 aa of MltD are a type II signal peptide. The proposed DniR function as a regulator of hexaheme nitrite reductase is probably artifactual. A mutant lacking five murein hydrolases (amiABCmltCD=MHD90) has a delayed lysis phenotype after beta-lactam treatment (Heidrich, 2002).

The first 19 aa of YafK are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. YafK has a degenerate LDT active site missing a conserved Cys residue.
b0225	EG13154	yafQ	mRNA interferase toxin of toxin-antitoxin pair YafQ/DinJ	Null	Translation inhibitor toxin of TA pair YafQ/DinJ; mRNA interferase	YafQ is homologous to the RelE toxin, which inhibits translation as a sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease. Coexpression of DinJ with YafQ blocks the growth inhibitory effect of YafQ (Motiejunaite, 2007; Szekeres, 2007). YafQ overexpression does not inhibit rich media growth completely (but does block growth on M9 glycerol plates) or cause a loss in CFU, as do the other toxins (Motiejunaite, 2007). DinJ and YafQ form a complex (Motiejunaite, 2007).

b0228	EG13150	rayT	RAYT REP element-mobilizing transposase; TnpA(REP)	Null	RAYT REP element-mobilizing transposase; TnpA(REP)	RAYT specifically binds, cleaves and recombines REP DNA in vitro (Ton-Hoang, 2011). The complex between RAYT and REPs is called a REPtron. RAYT is an IS200-related transposase whose orthologs are always flanked by a pair of REP clusters (BIMEs); transient DNA linkages to a tyrosine residue are a hallmark of IS200-related transposases; REP-containing genomes without rayT genes have a ten-fold lower number of REPs in their genomes; RAYT does not seem to mobilize itself in host genomes, but it is hypothesized that RAYT can mobilize REPs in trans, indicating that REPs may be a new class of nonautonomous transposable elements (TEs) thus providing a mechanism for REP multiplication and dispersal around bacterial genomes (Nunvar, 2010). REP doublets, renamed as REPINs, may be the mobilizable unit of a REP nonautonomous TE and REP singlets may be degraded doublets (Bertels, 2011).

Part of dinB-yafNOP operon. LexA regulon. The phenotype of some dinB alleles to reduce spontaneous mutations may be due to polarity effects.
b0232	EG13151	yafN	antitoxin of the YafO-YafN toxin-antitoxin system	Null	Antitoxin for YafO toxin	YafN is an essential gene; although there is a deletion of yafN in the Keio collection, that deletion strain also has a frameshift mutation in yafO, allowing the deletion of yafN (Singletary, 2009). YafN is an StbD homolog and a distant homolog of DnaT. LexA regulon. dinB-yafNOP operon. The phenotype of some dinB alleles to reduce spontaneous mutations may be due to polarity effects. LexA regulon.

The phenotype of some dinB alleles to reduce spontaneous mutations may be due to polarity effects on yafO. Overexpression causes filamentous biofilm formation and increased CV staining. Overexpression is reported to inhibit growth (Brown, 2003).

The FrsA N-terminus has been verified by MS, fMet is clipped (Koo, 2004). 8/228 FrsA(YafA) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007). FrsA peptide masses from MS/MS analysis indicate this is the correct start site and that the initial Met is removed (Guo, 2014).
b0240	EG11092	crl	pseudogene, sigma factor-binding protein, RNA polymerase holoenzyme formation stimulator	Regulator; Surface structures	Pseudogene, sigma factor-binding protein; stimulates RNAP holoenzyme formation; stimulates RpoS activity during stationary phase; mutants display rpoS mutant phenocopy; mutant does not have reduced amount of RpoS protein	RpoD, RpoS and RpoH sigma factor-containing holoenzyme assembly is stimulated by Crl (Gaal, 2006). Accumulation of Crl during stationary phase at 30C, but not 37C, suggests it is a thermosensor controlling sigma(S) activity. Initially identified due to reduction of RpoS-dependent curlin (csgAB) expression. The crl IS1I insertion after codon 33 creating a pseudogene in MG1655(Seq) (ATCC 700926; CGSC 7740) is a lab mutation acquired during the genome sequencing process; the parental MG1655 strain (ATCC 47076; CGSC 6300) has an intact crl gene (Freddolino, 2012).

b0251	EG13337	yafY	lipoprotein, inner membrane; degP regulator; CP4-6 prophage	Phage or Prophage Related	Inner membrane lipoprotein, function unknown; overproduction stimulates degP expression; CP4-6; putative prophage remnant	yfjS and yafY are homologs. The first 17 aa of YafY are a type II signal peptide (Matsuyama, unpublished, cited in Miyadai, 2004). Although overproduction of YafY induces degP expression, YjfS does not; chimeric protein experiments demonstrate that the N- and C- termini of YafY have the degP stimulatory determinants (Miyadai, 2004). Originally, the annotation of yafY was fused to the upstream pseudogene ykfK. It is possible that a YkfK-YafW chimeric pseudogene product is made in vivo, but no function would be expected since cleavage of the type II signal is likely to be blocked in any chimeric protein synthesized. Expression of the native YafY lipoprotein gene in the chromosome has not yet been reported. E. coli B has a third protein in this family (UniProtKB: A2UFU7), 55% identical to YafY and YfjS, that demonstrates conservation of the shorter ORFs and their lipoprotein signals in this novel prophage gene family.

There are no intact alleles of yagJ found in E. coli or Shigella strains, but an 857 amino acid ortholog from Escherichia albertii TW07627 (UniProtKB:B1EG49) is 93% identical across the C-terminal 275 residues. yagJ' has apparently been interrupted and partially deleted by IS1C. B1EG49 and other homologs of YagJ' have been annotated as type III restriction enzyme res subunits, but the pfam04851 domain hit is partial and weak, making that functional prediction unlikely; the B1EG49 hit to the helicase superfamily II domain (COG1061) is a more reasonable prediction (3e-05).

The frmRAB operon is negatively regulated by frmR, is induced by formaldehyde, and probably degrades formaldehyde. FrmB is 50% identical to P. denitrificans S-formylglutathione hydrolase. FrmB and YeiG are 50% identical paralogs; double mutant is formaldehyde sensitive; this may explain why an frmB single mutant did not have a formadehyde phenotype when tested on Biolog plates (Herring, 2004). The amino terminal half of FrmB is homologus to the C-terminal half of YieL. S9 peptidase family; YeiG or FrmB are not in MEROPS yet, but it has homologs.

Although originally reported not to have beta-lactamase activity, a subsequent study demonstrated that AmpH has a very weak beta-lactamase activity using nitrocefin as the substrate; this activity is about 0.1% of the rate for AmpC, a known weak beta-lactamase (Henderson, 1997; Gonz��lez-Leiza, 2011). A cleavable 21 aa type I signal peptide for AmpH is strongly predicted by SignalP and cleavage at this site has been confirmed by mass loss observed using LC-MS, although since the mature N-terminus was not sequenced AmpH is not in the Verified Set; the 23 aa cleaved N-terminal sequence reported includes the N-terminal MG dipeptide added by the pET vector (Gonz��lez-Leiza, 2011). AmpH is firmly membrane-anchored and needs a strong detergent treatment to solubilize, however no transmembrane segments are predicted (Gonz��lez-Leiza, 2011).

Intact versions of YkiA are also found in E. coli strains O157:H7, O55:H7 and TW10509, annotated as 721 aa proteins although their predicted signal peptides are encoded in the upstream DNA. Many E. coli strains, including K-12, contain trucated pseudogene C-terminal forms of YkiA, usually annotated as intact genes starting at an in-frame TTG, giving a protein sequence of 93 aa; however an additional 20 aa encoded upstream of these pseudogenes matches the intact alleles. Intact YkiA and YdbD are predicted secreted proteins that are paralogous. The intact YkiA alleles are predicted to have 22 aa type I signal peptides.

The same (probable) promoter-up mutation was isolated as rescuing both fructose (Sproul, 2001) and glucose kinase (Miller, 2005) deficiences. The original interpretation of the mak-up mutation as being in the mak coding region has been clarified by identifying the GTG initiation codon at the previous codon 47, placing the mak-up mutation in the putative promoter region. The unpublished protein sequencing is noted in Miller (2005) and the actual protein sequence data obtained (MRIGIDLGGTKTEVIALGDAGEQLY) was provided as a personal communication from Brian Miller (March, 2006).

NrdR is homologous to S. coelicolor NrdR (Borovok, 2004). NrdR binding sites have been predicted for the nrdAB, nrdDG, and nrdHIEF operons (Rodionova, 2005). This corresponds to putative TF Binding Site Cluster E581 for nrdD and nrdA (Qin, 2003). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). nrdR is the first gene in the putative nrdR-ribDE-nusB operon.

b0419	EG13611	yajO	2-carboxybenzaldehyde reductase	Null	2-carboxybenzaldehyde reductase	YajO, an AKR7A5 family aldo-keto reductase, reduces 2-carboxybenzaldehyde like other AKR7A family enzymes; but significant activities with other substrates, including other aromatic aldehydes, glyceraldehyde, glucuronic acid, methylglyoxal, phenylglyoxal, and xylose, were not detected (Ko, 2005). YajO does not have glyoxal or glycolaldehyde reductase activity and a yajO deletion does not increase sensitivity to glyoxal, glycolaldehyde or methylglyoxal (Lee, 2013). Using a mutant strain that accumulates toxic levels of methylglyoxal, it was observed that a yajO deletion strain has a 40% higher level of methylgloxal catabolites (acetol and 1,2-PDO) than a yajO+ strain, although the reason for this elevated catabolite level is not known (Ko, 2005). YajO requires GroE (GroES and GroEL) for proper folding in vivo (Kerner, 2005; Fujiwara, 2010).

The synonym nuvA is assigned to thiI: a nuvA mutant is near-UV resistant and maps to 9.3' (Mueller, 1998). ThiI has rhodanase and THUMP domains. Two reports of thiI complementation of nuvC were noted in Taylor (1998): footnote 3 cites (Mueller, 1998), but that complemented "nuvC" allele was not the original nuvC allele but a thiI mutant with the same phenotype isolated using the same procedure; footnote 2 attributes the complementation to C. Kinsland and T. P. Begley, unpublished results, and these results ars still unpublished. ThiI probably transfers sulfur to adenylated substrates. Two components Factor A (NuvA, 9.3) and Factor B (NuvB, ~45') were originally shown to be required for tRNA s(4)U8 modification with NuvC being the pyridoxal phosphate requiring factor; despite the mapping discrepancy it seems likely that IscS (57.3') is Factor C (NuvC) and ThiI (9.3') is Factor A (NuvA) (Kambampati, 2000).
b0424	EG13272	yajL	oxidative-stress-resistance chaperone	Null	Covalent chaperone for sulfenylated thiol proteins; confers resistance to oxidative stress, chaperone activity; mutant accumulates protein aggregates	The YajL chaperone forms mixed disulfides with target proteins, preferentially at sulfenylated cysteines (Le, 2012; Gautier, 2012). YajL stimulates refolding of citrate cynthase in vitro, and a yajL mutant has increased protein aggregation during aerobiosis, is sensitive to oxidative stress, and has reduced mRNA levels for the aggregated proteins (Kthiri, 2010). YajL has been mistakenly described as ThiJ, involved in thiamine metabolism. This phenotype is now attributed to the adjacent thiI gene (T.

Like GlnB, the GlnK protein is a member of the trimeric PII signal transduction protein family. In nitrogen limitation it is subject to post-translational modification by uridylylation (mediated by GlnD) of Tyr51 in the T-loop of each subunit. This modification is reversed in N-sufficient conditions. In ammonium sufficient conditions non-uridylylated GlnK forms a 1:1 complex with the ammonia channel protein AmtB and prevents ammonium uptake through AmtB. Complex formation is reversed by ammonium starvation. [Comment provided by EcoTeam member Mike Merrick, 11.16.06]
b0451	EG11821	amtB	ammonium transporter	Putative transport; Central intermediary metabolism: Pool, multipurpose conversions	Ammonia gas channel; sequesters GlnK, a negative regulator of AmtB activity, to the inner membrane; bi-directional facilitated diffusion	AmtB is a trimeric inner membrane protein. Each subunit has 11 TM helices; a predicted N-terminal 12th TM helix is actually a cleaved signal peptide. Ammonium is proposed to bind to the periplasmic face of AmtB and then to be deprotonated to ammonia for diffusion through the AmtB channel, then reprotonated by water to hydrate the ammonia gas to ammonium ion in the cytoplasm. AmtB enables growth on ammonium as sole nitrogen source at low ammonium ion concentrations (Soupene, 1998). The human Rh proteins are AmtB homologs and have been variously proposed to act as ammonia channels or as carbon dioxide gas channels.

YbaZ binds O(6)-alkylguanine residues in DNA and blocks alkyltransferase action; YbaZ does not remove methyl groups from O(6)-methylguanine-containing DNA nor does it have glycosylase or endonuclease activity (Margison, 2007). YbaZ preferentially binds DNA with an abasic site, has base-flipping activity, and binds HelD (Chen, 2008). YbaZ strongly enhances nucleotide excision repair of the large O(6)-alkylguanine adducts that are not good substrates for paralogs Ogt and Ada to remove (Mazon, 2009).

The expression of the hly operon of plasmid pHly152 is modulatedby Hha/HN-S. Overexpression of Cnu(YdgT) partially suppresses the hha defect on hylA expression. Hha positively modulates H-NS expression. Induced during biofilm formation. Structural mimicry and sequence similarity between the Hha/Cnu family of H-NS binding proteins and the H-NS/Stp family N-terminal dimerization domain has been proposed (Nieto, 2002; Madrid, 2007). There is some structural resemblance between Hha/Cnu and the H-NS/Stp N-terminal but whether it reflects a homologous family relationship or convergent evolution seems uncertain.

b0489	EG13258	qmcA	PHB domain membrane-anchored putative protease	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Multicopy suppressor of ftsH htpX double mutant; membrane-anchored predicted protease with C-terminal cytoplasmic PHB domain	Prohibitin homology (PHB) domain. The PHB domain is also called the SPFH domain, named after the proteins Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin and HflK/C (Tavernarakis, 1999; Morrow, 2005; Rivera-Milla, 2006; Browman, 2007). QmcA belongs to subfamily SPFH1a (Hinderhofer, 2009). QmcA is oligomeric and interacts with ftsH. QmcA suppressor activity, but not protein synthesis, is stimulated by downstream NfeD/STOPP family gene ybbJ. QmcA expression from the chromosome is detected, but must be insufficient for suppression. QmcA is not stably complexed with FtsH, but they do physically interact.
b0490	EG13259	fetA	iron export ABC transporter ATPase; peroxide resistance protein	Transport; Transport of small molecules: Cations	Iron export ABC transporter ATPase; peroxide resistance protein	FetAB confers peroxide resistance and exports excess iron; overexpression of FetAB increases peroxide resistance and fetA or fetB mutants are sensitive to peroxide stress (Nicolaou, 2013).
b0491	EG13260	fetB	iron export ABC transporter permease; peroxide resistance protein	Transport; Transport of small molecules: Cations	Iron export ABC transporter permease; peroxide resistance protein	FetAB confers peroxide resistance and exports excess iron; overexpression of FetAB increases peroxide resistance and fetA or fetB mutants are sensitive to peroxide stress (Nicolaou, 2013). FetA is an integral mebrane protein with the C-terminus inside the cytoplasm (Daley, 2005; Nicolaou, 2013).
b0492	EG13261	ybbN	DnaK co-chaperone, thioredoxin-like protein	Putative enzyme; Not classified	DnaK co-chaperone, thioredoxin-like protein; probable DNA replicase folding chaperone; has SXXC not CXXC motif	YbbN is a co-chaperone for both DnaJKGrpE and GroESL(Lin, 2011). YbbN assists in refolding of DnaN, and ybbN mutants produce anucleated cells and have DNA replication defects (Le, 2011). YbbN has two tandem C-terminal TPR-like repeat domains. The function of YbbN as both an thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase and as a chaperone is controversial (Vlamis-Gardikas, 2008): YbbN has been reported to oxidize cysteines of RNase A and to have chaperone activity (Caldas, 2006), but this is partially contradicted by a report that YbbN cannot reduce oxidized insulin and has no chaperone activity on citrate synthase (Pan, 2006). This contradiction is substantially resolved by a followup to the Caldas (2006) study which found no evidence for YbbN oxidoreductase activity in vivo and and agree with Pan (2006) that there is no significant in vitro chaperone activity of YbbN alone on citrate syntase, but there is a strong stimulation of DnaK chaperone activity on citrate syntase, thus YbbN is a DnaK co-chaperone (Kthiri, 2008). YbbN binds DnaK and GroEL; ybbN mutants are sensitive to heat stress but not oxidative stress (Kthiri, 2008). HT_Cmplx38_Cyt: Usg+YbbN. otherPDB (S.typhimurium): 3QDN.

b0497	EG10849	rhsD	Rhs protein with DUF4329 family putative toxin domain; putative neighboring cell growth inhibitor	Null	Rhs protein with DUF4329 family putative toxin domain; putative neighboring cell growth inhibitor	It has been suggested that all Rhs systems are involved in intercellular growth inhibition, suggesting that the Rhs proteins are secreted from E. coli and that the variable C-terminal domains are toxic to neighboring cells when secreted to the outside of the cell (Koskiniemi, 2013). rhsD has been predicted to encode a polymorphic toxin and the downstream gene encodes YbbC, a predicted immunity protein (Zhang, 2012).
b0498	EG11769	ybbC	putative immunity protein 	Null	Putative NTF2 fold immunity protein for RhsD toxin	The ybbC gene is downstream of the rhsD predicted polymorphic toxin gene and ybbC is predicted to encode an immunity protein (Zhang, 2012). YbbC has a possibly false positive lipoprotein prediction, the putative lipidated Cys residue is not well conserved (Gonnet, 2004). ybbC and yhhH are paralogs.

b0501	EG11770	ybbD	pseudogene	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, novel conserved family	YbbD is a member of conserved protein family of unknown function. The intact Salmonella homolog is STM3527 (SP: Q8ZLH3). A frameshift at codon 80 was hypothetically reconstructed. An intact allele from Shigella boydii (SBO_0403) allows identification of the frameshift mutation: a run of 8 Ts starting at codon 80 is a run of 7 Ts in K-12. SBO_0403 is also a pseudogene with a frameshift at codon 138. Intact 163 codon versions are present in E. coli strains E22, B7A, E110019 and 53638. A homolog in Delftia acidovorans confirms that this is a conserved protein sequence. ybbD is downstream of the rhsE' secreted polymorphic toxin pseudogene and therefore may encode a novel immunity protein for RhsE'.

The crystal structure of AllA from E. coli O157:H7 (PDB:1YQC) differs from K-12 at a single position, C51R (Raymond, 2005). The crystal structure of AllA from Shigella flexneri (PDB:1XSR) differs from K-12 at a single position, C51R. AllA has long been misannotated as ureidoglycolate hydrolase in many database entries and publications (Percudani, 2013).

AllR(GclR) and IclR can bind to the same DNA sequence so IclR binds to the AllR(GclR) binding site at the gcl promoter but a deletion of IclR has no effect on gcl transcription, implying other factor(s) may be involved (Walker, 2006).

The sfmACDHF-sfmZ genes in centisome 12 are a remnant of a region that is orthologous to the Salmonella enterica fimA[I]CDHF-fim[WY]Z convergent operons also in centisome 12; both are adjacent to the argU tRNA gene; an ancestral sfmWYZ operon was apparently disrupted by the insertion of the DLP prophage, resulting in the loss of the sfmWY genes; fimI (like E. coli fimI) and STM05551 (between fimW and fimY) are specific to Salmonella. The cognate sensor histidine kinase for SfmZ(FimZ) and the orphan response regulator FimZ in Salmonella is unknown, but evidence suggests it should exist elsewhere where on the Salmonella chromosome, and by analogy also SfmZ might have a cognate sensor elsewhere; both fimY and fimZ are needed for fim expression in Salmonella; FimW is a FimZ-interacting proteni that does not bind DNA although it appears to be distantly related to the DNA-binding response regulators (Zeiner, 2013).

Correct structures are now available. EmrE belongs to the SMR efflux pump family, DMT superfamily. EmrE accomplishes multidrug efflux by coupling conformational changes between two heterodimers with proton gradient. Although the dual-topology membrane protein structure suggested by the original cryo EM studies has been controversial, the emerging consensus from different experimental approaches is that EmrE is an asymmetric dimer with the two monomers in antiparallel orientations in the membrane (Korkhov, 2009).

YbcN is a distant homolog of the phage lambda orf recombinase, YbcN preferentially binds to ssDNA and YbcN binds to the C-terminus of SSB (Curtis, 2014). In a global protein-protein interaction study SSB and YbcN were found to interact (Arifuzzaman, 2006).

QuuD(YbaQ) is a phage antiterminator Q protein family 1 domain member (pfam06530). Transcriptional antiterminator proteins bind to RNA polymerase and allow readthrough of rho-independent terminators, positively regulating the expression of downstream genes.

The first 22 aa are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. However, N-terminal sequencing revealed cleavage after residue 21; the CusF clone construct had eight additional amino acids added at the N-terminus; the cleavage specificity may have been altered by the additional amino acids or the prediction is incorrect (Fanake, 2003).

Although YbdG has a conductance similar to MscM and was previously proposed to be a component of the originally observed MscM activity, identification of YjeP as the protein responsible for the original MscM activity indicates that YjeP should be renamed as MscM (Edwards, 2012). Following the suggestion to rename YjeP as MscM, yjeP has been renamed as mscM. mscS, mscK(kefA), mscM(yjeP), ybiO, ybdG and ynaI are paralogs of the MscS family.

A peptide encoded in the 26 aa N-terminal extension was identified in a shotgun MS experiment, supporting the upstream start site for Fes (Krug, 2013). Although neither of the proposed start sites for Fes have good RBS sites, the downstream ATG is not conserved whereas the upstream start site and amino acid sequence is conserved.

The chain-releasing thioesterase (TE) domain of EntF is both a cyclotrimerizing lactone synthase and an elongation catalyst for ester-bond formation between covalently tethered dihydroxybenzoate-serine moieties (Shaw-Reid, 1999). The adenylation activity of EntF is stimulated by the co-purifying MbtH-like factor YbdZ; the affinity of EntF for L-ser was improved 15-fold in the presence of YbdZ (Felnagle, 2010). In addition to its role in iron acquisition, enterobactin plays a role in oxidative stress protection and is required to form colonies on M9 minimal media aerobically (Adler, 2014).

A dppG (originally called dpp) mutation involved in dipeptide transport was mapped near cstA and may be allelic to cstA, with the caveat that a cstA opp double mutant does not display the valyl dipeptide resistance phenotype observed for dpp mutants (Schultz, 1991). Paralogs cstA and yjiY are both in operons with paralogous small proteins of unknown function, ybdD and yjiX, respectively. CstA has an N-terminal CstA domain (PF02554) and a C-terminal CstA-associated DUF4161 domain (PF13722) of unknown function; the CstA domain is a member of the APC clan (CL0062) of APC (Amino acid-Polyamine-organoCation) superfamily transporters.

b0612	EG13538	citT	citrate/succinate antiporter; citrate carrier	Putative membrane; Not classified	Citrate/succinate antiporter; citrate carrier	CitT is an inner membrane protein with 12 TM regions that has been identified as a citate/succcinate antiporter faciltating citrate transport in vivo and in vitro, with additional substrates including C4-dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates (Pos, 1998). CitT is a member of the IT (Ion Transporter) superfamily (Prakash, 2003). CitT belongs to the ST(3) structural class based on hydropathy profile (Lolkema, 2003). The N-terminal periplasmic sensor domain of CitA functions as a high-affinity citrate receptor (Kaspar, 2002). E. coli cannot use citrate as a carbon and energy source for aerobic growth like Klebsiella does (Koser, 1924). Citrate can be catabolized during anaerobic growth in the presence of an oxidizable co-substrate such as glucose, lactose or glycerol; the co-substrate provides needed reducing power (L��tgens, 1980). Aerobic utilzation of citrate is blocked by low CitT transporter expression, which can be overcome using a plasmid-encoded transporter (Pos, 1998). In addition to inducing the cit operon and citAB, adding citrate to anaerobic cultures up-regulates the mdh gene needed to convert the oxoaloacetate prodcut to malate (Yamamoto, 2008). The cytoplasmic transmitter domain of autophosphorylated CitA transphosphorylates the CitB receiver domain, causing the CitB DNA-binding output HTH domain to bind to the citCDEFXGT-citAB divergent promoter region and activate transcription of both operons; the reduction of CitA Cys529 is essential for autophosphorylation, perhaps acting as an oxygen-sensing inhibition mechanism, restricting cit gene expression to the anaerobic growth conditions that enable citrate-glucose co-fermentation (Yamamoto, 2008; Yamamoto, 2009). In addition to its role in citrate utilization, CitAB(DpiBA) may be involved in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance; the citC-T and citAB(dpiBA) operons are induced by beta-lactam treatment and shifting an ftsI(ts) strain to the non-permissive temperature, in a citB(dpiA)-independent mechanism; both treatments also induce the lexA-, recA-dependent SOS response, dependent upon the citB(dpiA) induction, and lexA or recA mutants block the SOS-dependent antibiotic-induced induction of the cit genes; the antibiotic MICs are not affected by citA or citB mutations, viability of a citB(dpiA) mutant is reduced 10-fold as compared to wildtype cells after overnight antibiotic exposure in liquid cultures (Miller, 2004). Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance (Hirakawa, 2003). Deletion of citAB(dpiBA) did not change the sensitivity to 240 antibiotics and other growth inhibitors; likewise growth was unaltered in 1000 other growth-based assays such as various carbon and nitrogen source utilizations; the anaerobic utilization of citrate was not tested (Zhou, 2003). In vivo overproduced CitAB(DpiBA) stimulates the citC promoter and represses the appY promoter (Ingmar, 1998). Among other functions, the global transcriptional regulator AppY stimulates expression of the anaerobically-induced energy metabolism operons hyaA-F and cbdABX-appA (Br?ndsted, 1996; Atlung, 1996; Atlung, 1997). Overproduced CitA(DpiB) destabilizes pSC101 (and other) plasmid inheritance, hence the synonyms dpiAB, and induces the SOS repsonse, acting by CitB(DpiA) binding to the AT-rich plasmid ori region and the chromosomal origin, respectively; citAB(dpiBA) mutants have no effect on plasmid inheritance (Ingmer, 1998; Miller, 2003). The citA(criR) gene was identified as a transcriptional regulator of the ipa pathogenicity island in Shigella flexneri, but E. coli K-12 does not have the ipa genes (Qi, 1996; Walker, 2002). ChiX(RybC,MicM) regulates citAB(dpiBA) mRNA; citAB(dpiBA) mRNA may be a ChiX trap-mRNA (also called an RNA decoy) (Mandin, 2009).

Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance, but has no effect on beta-lactam resistance (Hirakawa, 2003a; Hirakawa, 2003b).

Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance, but has no effect on beta-lactam resistance (Hirakawa, 2003a; Hirakawa, 2003b).

E. coli cannot use citrate as a carbon and energy source for aerobic growth like Klebsiella does (Koser, 1924). Citrate can be catabolized during anaerobic growth in the presence of an oxidizable co-substrate such as glucose, lactose or glycerol; the co-substrate provides needed reducing power (L��tgens, 1980). Aerobic utilization of citrate is blocked by low CitT transporter expression, which can be overcome using a plasmid-encoded transporter (Pos, 1998). In addition to inducing the cit operon and citAB, adding citrate to anaerobic cultures up-regulates the mdh gene needed to convert the oxoaloacetate product to malate (Yamamoto, 2008).

A cspE-flc(crcB) double mutant confers camphor-sensitivity and exacerbates the phenotypes of topo IV and MukB mutants (Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone compensates for a loss of the normal condensin MukBEF and recondenses chromosomes decondensed by camphor treatment (Hu, 1996; Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone increases plasmid DNA supercoiling and reduces DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutant phenotypes (Sand, 2003). The phoP-activation phenotype was initially characterized in Salmonella then confirmed in E. coli (Jia, 2004). SignalP-NN incorrectly predicts a 27 aa signal peptide, but the verified cleavage site after 25 aa is predicted as a second possible cleavage site by SignalP-NN and as the only cleavage site by the more recent SignalP-HMM predictor (see SignalP button below).

CspE is a cold shock protein homolog, but is constitutively expressed at 37C. CspE has transcription antitermination activity (Bae, 2000). CspE affects rpoS and uspA expression. CspE is a negative regulator of cspA transcription. A cspE-flc(crcB) double mutant confers camphor-hypersensitivity and exacerbates the phenotypes of topo IV and MukB mutants, indicating that CspE and Flc(CrcB) may have a (possibly redundant) role in maintaining condensed chromosomes, either direct or indirect, possibly through the regulation of other gene products (Sand, 2003). CspE dimers bind ssDNA containing six or more contiguous dT residues with high affinity; CspE dimers binding two distant chromosome regions possible explains a condensin role for cspE when overexpressed with pagP(crcA) and flc(crcB) to suppress mukB mutations and confer camphor resistance (Hu, 1996; Johnston, 2006). Multicopy expression of cspE alone confers 10-fold camphor-resistance, a cspE-flc(crcB) clone confers 100-fold resistance, and the cspE-pagP-crcB clone confers 1000-fold resistance (single flc(crcB) or pagP clones had no effect); it is not known if the pagP gene product is contributing or if the three gene clone just expresses more flc(crcB) and/or cspE (Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone increases plasmid DNA supercoiling and reduces DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutant phenotypes (Sand, 2003). The cspE gene was also identified as a "negative regulator of growth in the cold", named as gicA, and submitted to Genbank (L29054) (Ramanathan Y., Narayanarao A.V.S.S., Mathur M., Mahajan S.K., Thesis (1994), University of Bombay, India). otherPDB (S. typhimurium): 3I2Z.

The E. coli K-12 Flc(CrcB) protein is a dual-topopogy membrane protein (Rapp, 2006). A Flc(CrcB) family protein from an E. coli virulence plasmid has been shown to be a homodimeric inner membrane fluoride-specific efflux channel; the membrane topologies of Flc(CrcB) family members from B. pertussis and L. acidophilus have four transmembrane helices and the Flc(CrcB) subunits have opposite orientation topologies; the CrcB family of fluoride export channels has been renamed as the Fluc family (Stockbridge, 2013). There is already a flu gene in E. coli so crcB has been renamed as flc instead of fluC, which is retained as a synonym. E. coli K-12 Flc(CrcB) is an inner membrabe proteono with four predicted transmembrane helicies (Daley, 2005). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone compensates for a loss of the normal condensin MukBEF and recondenses chromosomes decondensed by camphor treatment (Hu, 1996; Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone increases plasmid DNA supercoiling and reduces DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutant phenotypes (Sand, 2003).

b0658	EG13654	ybeX	putative ion transport	Putative transport; Not classified	Heat shock protein, putative Co2+ and Mg2+ efflux protein; contains two CBS domains	YbeX has been shown to be a heat shock protein and to be in the RpoH regulon (Nonaka, 2006). YbeX(CorC) of Salmonella has been shown to be involved in Co2+ and Mg2+ efflux (Gibson, 1991). YbeX has structural similarity to the regulatory domain from d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.

Four ribonucleases, Rnc, Rnr, Pnp and Rph, redundantly process 16S rRNA, and although this does not rule out a role for YbeY as co-ribonuclease with Rnr, the role of YbeY as being the nuclease activity responsible for the removal of the 33 nucleotides at the 3' end of 16S rRNA has been questioned (Sulthana, 2013). Structural homology analysis of YbeY indicates similarity to eukaryotic collagenase and gelatinase (Zhan, 2005). No collagenase, gelatinase or other hydrolase activity could be demonstrated for YbeY from A. aeolicus (Rasouly, 2009). The YbeY-bound metal is most likely nickel (Zhan, 2005). YbeY has been shown to be a heat shock protein and to be in the RpoH regulon (Nonaka, 2006; Rasouly, 2009). YbeY is induced during an unfolded protein response initiated with canavanine treatment (Rasouly, 2009). ybeY mutants accumulate 16S rRNA precursors (18S) and their mutant phenotypes are exacerbated by rnc, rnr and pnp mutations (Davies, 2010).

Wanner, 2003). YbeZ has been shown to be a heat shock protein and to be in the RpoH regulon (Nonaka, 2006; Rasouly, 2009). YbeZ is induced during an unfolded protein response initiated with canavanine treatment (Rasouly, 2009). 9/334 YbeZ peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007).

However an RNA transcript complementary to glnU detectable only in an RNase P deficient strain was found using microarrays and confirmed with a Northern blot (Li, 2003). The nature, length, and start site of this b0669 transcript is not known: it may be a novel sRNA, it may encode a small protein, it may be a ubiF readthrough transcript, or it might represent a spurious non-physiological transcription event due to the rpesence of an accidental promoter.

ChiX(MicM) sRNA is degraded after chb operon mRNA induction by chitobiose or chitotriose, mediated by a chiX(micM) antisense RNA in the chbBC intergenic region (Overgaard, 2009). ChiP(YbfM) has been characterized in Salmonella as a porin required for uptake of chitin-derived oligosaccharides regulated by the ChiX(MicM) sRNA (Figueroa-Bossi, 2009). ChiP(YbfM) is related to the PorD porin of P. aeruginosa. The first 32 aa of ChiP(YbfM) are a probable signal peptide. chiP(ybfM) and uidC are paralogs. ChiP is also the name of an OmpC-related chitoporin in Vibrio sp., so ChiP(YbfM) was named ChiP-III and was predicted to be a porin for chitobiose in Salmonella and E. coli (Yang, 2006).

SeqA sequesters newly replicated hemimethylated oriC origins to prevent re-initiation. SeqA is required for the membrane binding of hemimethylated oriC in vitro. SeqA may facilitate cII binding to phage lambda promoters, enhancing transcription. The SeqA self-association function is in the N-terminal domain. DNA-binding activity is in C-terminal domain. SeqA expression is negatively modulated by HU. SeqA is a homotetramer. aphA(hobH) mutants overproduce SeqA.

b0691	EG11777	ybfG	pseudogene	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, DUF2625 family	YbfG' was a member of the DUF2625 family of unknown function. An in-frame stop at codon 70 of ybfG' is replaced with an X in the reconstruction. An intact allele of ybfG' is found in E. coli 53638 as Ecol5_01004515 (Genbank gi:75511145). Additional intact alleles of ybfG' can be found in strains E. coli 101-1 and Shigella boydii Sb227 (UniProtKB: Q324L5 has the C-terminal 120 aa of YbfG). All three intact alleles of ybfG' have a Trp codon in place of the in-frame stop at codon 70. Most orthologs of ybfG' also have a Trp at position 70, but Burkholderia cepacia has Tyr70. The F. johnsoniae (UniProtKB: Q1XKB8) and S. coelicolor (UniProtKB: Q9RI76) orthologs have N-terminal extensions due to the annotation of non-conserved alternative initiation codons. The YbfG' pseudogene product has been reported to be down-regulated by beryllium, possibly expressing the N-terminal fragment which could be expressed, even if non-functional (Taylor-McCabe, 2006).

Inhibition of KdpD phosphatase activity leads to an accumulation of phospho-KdpE and activation of kdpFABC transcription. KdpD phosphatase activity directed at KdpE was initially suggested to be inhibited by turgor pressure, but this has been refuted (Hamann, 2008). Dephosphorylated PTS system EIIA(Ntr) protein PtsN binds to and stimulates sensor kinase KdpD activity, increasing the levels of the cognate phosphorylated response regulator KdpE (L��ttmann, 2009). Since high K+ concentrations lower phosphoryated KdpE, it was suggested that high intracellular potassium downregulates the KdpD autophosphoryation activity, resulting in less phosphotransferance to KdpE (Heermann, 2009; L��ttmann, 2009). A salt shock increases ATP concentrations and probably stimulates KdpD phosphatase activity since a deletion of the ATP-binding site of KdpD deregulates its phosphatase activity (Ohwada, 1987; Jung, 1998).

Inhibition of KdpD phosphatase activity leads to an accumulation of phospho-KdpE and activation of kdpFABC transcription. KdpD phosphatase activity directed at KdpE was initiially suggested to be inhibited by turgor pressure, but this has been refuted (Hamann, 2008).

b0710	EG13305	ybgI	GTP cyclohydrolase-like radiation resistance protein; metal-binding	Putative enzyme; Not classified	GTP cyclohydrolase-like radiation resistance protein; metal-binding	YbgI belongs to the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 type 2/NIF3 family (InterPro IPR002678; Pfam PF01784) whose most characterized prokaryotic member is the Helicobacter pylori GTP cyclohydrolase 1 type 2 (HP0959) (Choi, 2013). A ybgI mutation is one of many selected in a strain evolved for resistance to high levels of ionizing radiation; a single ybgI deletion mutant has a 2-3 orders of magnitude drop in survival after radiation exposure as compared to a ybgI+ strain (Byrne, 2014). Although YbgI is labeled as a putative GTP cyclohydrolase in many annotations of YbgI orthologs, there are several reasons to consider a substrate related to but distinct from GTP for YbgI. First, GTP cyclohydrolase 1 activity has been purified from E. coli and only FolE was isolated (Yim, 1976). Second, a folE mutant has a phenotype that cannot be satisfied by a presumably still intact copy of ybgI (Klaus, 2005). Third, the amino acid sequence identity between HP0959 and YbgI is only 27% (29/105) and only the last 101 amino acids align to YbgI using blastp; this is usually considered as too divergent to assume isofunctional orthology. Fourth, YbgI provides significant protection from radiation damage and may be involved in the degradation of radiation-damaged nucleotides; ybgI linkage (genetic neighborhood) to two genes involved in DNA repair, nei and phr, is conserved across many bacterial genomes perhaps indicating that they work together; consistent with this hypothesis the Phr product is a DNA photolyase that repairs cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers in DNA and Nei is part of the damaged base excision repair (BER) pathway. There is some evidence from high-throughput studies that YbgIJK-Nei might be a protein complex. YbgI is a member of the widely conserved protein family UPF0135. YbgI has a dinuclear metal site.

E. coli SdhE(YgfY, CbtB) can complement the growth defect associated with a Serratia ygfX sdhE double mutant; Serratia SdhE was shown to bind FAD and to facilitate the flavinylation of SdhA in vitro; an E. coli sdhE(cbtB) mutant has an inactive succinate dehydrogenase (McNeil, 2012). His45 was predicted to be the site of SdhA flavinylation with FAD by similarity to the sequenced histidine-modified bovine heart flavopeptide SHTVAAXGGIBLAAGBMDEBXWR (Kenney, 1972; Wood, 1984). In vitro flavinylation of SdhA using crude extracts was stimulated by citrate, isocitrate, succinate and fumarate (Brandsch, 1989). The sdhABCD operon is negatively regulated by ryhB RNA as part of indirect positive regulation by Fur. Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004).

Residues 104-153 is the E3(Lpd) component binding domain, called the peripheral subunit binding domain (PSBD). When the isolated 50 aa PSBD domain is produced as a protein it is called BBL, which is structured at low temperature and may be an example of a downhill protein folding (Packman, 1986; Garcia-Mira, 2002).

YbgE is the prototype for the Pfam profile PF09600. YbgE gives an ambiguous lipoprotein prediction, the Cys is somewhat conserved but has no LipoP or PATOSEQ predictions. YbgE is predicted to have three transmembrane helices with a cytoplasmic N-terminus topology.
b0736	EG11110	ybgC	acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase	Enzyme; Fatty acid and phosphatidic acid biosynthesis	Acyl-CoA thioesterase; possibly involved in phospholipid metabolism; binds ACP; acyl-ACP could be native substrate	YbgC-ACP forms an inner membrane complex with PssA and PlsB and is therefore presumed to be involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, possibly in the release of lipids from ACP or in the regulation of the stability or activity of the phospholipid synthetic enzymes PssA and PlsB, however a ybgC mutant did not exhibit qualitative differences in phospholipid composition (Gully, 2006). A ybgC insertion mutation has no obvious phenotype and is not polar on tolQ (Sun, 1987). It was suggested that YbgC might be DHNA-CoA thioesterase since the YbgC homolog Slr0204 of Synechocystis catalyzes DHNA-CoA hydrolysis, but it was subsequently shown that YbgC has no DHNA-CoA thioesterase activity and the real DHNA-CoA thioesterase is MenI(YdiI) (Jiang, 2010; Chen, 2013). ybgC is the first gene in the ybgC-tolQRA operon (Vianney, 1996; Muller, 1997). YbgC is not part of the Tol-Pal complex. YbgC is a low abundance protein (Fountoulakis, 1999). YbgC is a member of the hotdog superfamily of thioesterases and dehydratases (Pfam CL0050, PF03061; PDB 1S5U) (Dillon, 2004; Kim Y., Joachimiak A., Skarina T., Savchenko A., Edwards A., unpublished).

b0751	EG11700	pnuC	nicotinamide riboside transporter	Transport; Transport of small molecules: Nucleosides, purines, pyrimidines	Nicotinamide riboside uptake permease	E. coli PnuC is a nicotinamide riboside (NR) transporter that can import NR but not nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) when expressed in a Haemophilus influenzae pnuC mutant (Sauer, 2004). PnuC and NadR may constitute a two component group translocator whereby NadR has to phosphorylate NR to NMN to facilitate substrate release by PnuC into the cytoplasm. In Salmonella, PnuC was originally thought to import NMN directly, however it was subsequently shown to be an NR, not NMN, importer; a mutant form of PnuC was able to transport NMN directly; NMN is converted to NR in the Salmonella periplasm by AphA and this may also occur in E. coli (Foster, 1990; Grose, 2005).

GpmA does not have phosphatase activity against para-nitrophenyl phosphate (Foster, 2010). gpmM and gpmA are non-essential genes but phosphoglycerate mutase is an essential enzyme since a gpmA gpmM double mutation is lethal (Foster, 2010). GpmA is a member of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, represented by the InterPro superfamily profile IPR013078 and CDD cl11399 (also called the dPGM superfamily) including phosphatases and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases as well as factor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases; the histidine phosphatase superfamily is characterized by a conserved histidine that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle (Fothergill-Gilmore, 1989; Fothergill-Gilmore, 1990; Jedrzejas, 2000; Johnsen, 2007; Rigden, 2008; Foster, 2010).

Although YdhJ is an aconitase homolog, overexpression of cloned YdhJ does not increase cellular aconitase activity and ydhJ is not responsible for the 5% residual aconitase activity in acnAB double mutants; partially purified YdhJ has no aconitase activity with citrate or 2-methylcitrate, but does exhibit weak 2-methyl-cis-aconitate hydratase activity, although this could be due to a contaminating protein (Blank, 2002).

BioC and BioH are required to synthesize pimeloyl-ACP, a biotin precursor, utilizing the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis to add acyl groups to malonyl-CoA in two cycles to form pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester; BioC may methylate malonyl-ACP instead of malonyl-CoA (Lin, 2010).

Three global studies have identified YbhK as an FtsK-binding protein (Butland, 2005; Arifuzzaman, 2006; Hu, 2009). CofD proteins, 2-phospho-L-lactate transferases required for coenzyme F420 synthesis in methanogenic bacteria, and YcvK/YbhK proteins form two different clades of the CofD-YcvK superfamily; YcvK/YhbK proteins have altered substrate-binding pockets as compared to CofD but both sub-families may bind phosphate or phosphorylated substrates.

Inouye, personal communication). The BAX Inhibitor-1 (BI-1) family (previously called the TEGT or UPF0005 family) proteins are widely conserved; BI-1 has an anti-apoptotic function and forms a Ca(2+)-permeable channel; E. coli has three BI-1 family proteins: YccA, YbhM and YbhL (H��ckelhoven, 2004; Bultynck, 2011).

ClsB(YbhO) cardiolipin synthase activity was detected in vitro but not in vivo; the physiological significance of in vitro activity was unclear at the time (Guo, 2000). Previous attempts to express ClsB activity in vivo used a low salt medium which inhibits ClsB actvity; cloned gene expression of ClsB in high salt medium resulted in cardiolipin synthesis (Tan, 2012).

The periplasmic domain of YliE may be a YliE-specific periplasmic signaling domain or domain variant that does not match other known domain signatures. YliEF may constitute a cyclic-di-GMP synthesis/degradation module. A yliE rssB9(hnr) double null mutant has significantly increased lycopene production in 1X M9; the effect may be salt-suppressible as it is not seen in 2X M9 (Alper, 2008).

YliF has an N-terminal predicted periplasmic domain flanked by two predicted TM segments and has a C-terminal cytoplasmic diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain (Daley, 2005). The periplasmic domain of YliF may be a YliF-specific periplasmic signaling domain or domain variant that does not match other known domain signatures.

b0835	EG13478	rimO	ribosomal protein S12 methylthiotransferase	Null	Ribosomal protein S12 methylthiotransferase	rimO and miaB are paralogs. RimO catalyzes the methylthiolation of Asp-89 of ribosomal protein S12 to form 3-methylthioaspartic acid (Kowalak, 1996; Anton, 2008). YcaO is required for the efficient in vivo RimO-dependent beta-methylthiolation of ribosomal protein S12 (RpsL) on Asp-89 (Strader, 2011). Asp-88 of the mature RpsL is Asp-89 of the unmodified protein. The divergent rimO-bssR operon promoter region binds FNR and ArcA; rimO is activated by ArcA and FNR (Federowicz, 2014).

b0841	EG13676	ybjG	undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase	Null	Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase; YbjG(UppP), minor activity	The ybjG gene is not essential, but UppP activity is essential to synthesize undecaprenyl phosphate, a C55 lipid carrier for cell wall synthesis, so a ybjG pgpB bacA triple mutant is lethal as all three have UppP activity; overexpression, but not wildtype levels, of the LpxT(YeiU) undecaprenyl pyrophosphate:lipid A 1-phosphate phosphotransferase activity rescues the triple mutant (El Ghachi, 2005). Like the phosphatidylglycerophosphatase PgpB, which also has a minor UppP activity, YbjG may have a preferred substrate other than undecaprenyl pyrophosphate in vivo. ybjG, pgpB, and lpxT are paralogs. Mg(2+) stimulon-PhoPQ regulon, EvgAS-PhoPQ cascade enhanced-expression subset. ybjG and bacA are not involved in lipid A modification (Touze, 2008).

The C-terminal domain is not required for the function of MdfA. MdfA(Cmr) may also be an arabinose efflux transporter because an mdfA(cmr) mutant has increased intracellular arabinose, but not xylose; other compounds were not tested (Koita, 2012).

b0846	EG13680	rcdA	transcriptional regulator of csgD and ybiJI; autoregulator	Putative regulator; Not classified	Transcriptional regulator of csgD and ybiJI; autoregulator	TetR family. RcdA is a transcriptional activator for csgD, a transcriptional repressor for the divergent ybiJI operon, and a autoregulatory activator; additional verified direct targets in the RcdA regulon include sulA, asr, ydeI, and ycgF; some primary targets are themselves regulators and the indirect target csgB (regulated by CsgD) was verified by Northern blot; additional direct targets were identified by SELEX but not confirmed by Northern blot (Shimada, 2012). rcdA was referred to as rcdR in a subsequent publication from the same laboratory and even though this is probably a typographical error, rcdR is added as a synonm for rcdA to minimize confusion (Shimada, 2012; Shimada, 2013).

b0852	EG10852	rimK	ribosomal protein S6 modification protein	Structural component; Ribosomes - maturation and modification	Ribosomal protein S6 modification, C-terminal glutmate addition; polyglutamate synthase	RimK has poly-alpha-glutamic acid synthase activity in vitro, using glutamate as substrate (Kino, 2011).
b0853	EG13683	ybjN	multicopy suppressor of coaA(Ts); ionizing radiation survival protein; putative chaperone; putative negative regulator of fimbriae and motility	Putative regulator; Not classified	Multicopy suppressor of coaA(Ts); ionizing radiation survival protein; putative chaperone; putative negative regulator of fimbriae and motility	A ybjN mutation is one of many selected in a strain evolved for resistance to high levels of ionizing radiation; a single ybjN deletion mutant has about a ten-fold drop in survival after radiation exposure as compared to a ybjN+ strain (Byrne, 2014). A ybjN mutant appears to be upregulated for fimbriae, flagella, motility, capsule and biofilm production; overproduction of YbjN slows growth, induces toxin-antitoxin modules, causes autoaggregation, reduces motility, reduces biofilm formation, increases acid sensitivity, down-regulates gadA, gadB and gadE, and down-regulates fimbriae production; ybjN is optimally expressed in exponential phase cells at 28C; the coa(Ts) mutant ts19 has 10-fold less ybjN mRNA than a coa+ strain which may be related to its ability to suppress coa(Ts) although a ybjN mutant is not itself temperature sensitive (Wang, 2011). Constitutive expression of cloned marA in a marR mutant increases ybjN transcription 3-fold (Barbosa, 2000). YbjN over-expression suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of coa(Ts) mutants including ts19; YbjN may have chaperone-like properties (Chen, 2006). YbjN is the founding member of a superfamily (Pfam PF10722) that includes DR1245, a Deinococcus radiodurans protein that is a binding partner of the DNA damage response single-stranded DNA-binding protein DdrB; DdrB, but not DR1245, is upregulated after ionizing radiation and is required for survival after a high dose of ionizing radiation; mutants lacking DR1245, but not mutants lacking DdrB, have a slow growth phenotype; it was suggested that DR1245 might be a chaperone (Norais, 2013). YbjN family members identified using blastp are limited to the enterobacteria but YbjN superfamily members as identified with significant matches to Pfam PF10722 are more widespread; the YbjN superfamily is grouped into the same structural similarity clan (Pfam CL0097) as two type III secretion chaperone familes represented by Pfam PF07824 (SigE family) and PF05932 (CesT family) (Luo, 2001; Norais, 2013). YbjN(B0853) has been predicted to have thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity similar to that of the glutaredoxin/thioredoxin family (Fetrow, 1998). otherPDB(D. radiodurans):4H5B (Norais, 2013).

b0981	EG11826	etk	tyrosine-protein kinase, role in O-antigen capsule formation	Null	Tyrosine-protein kinase, required for O-antigen capsule formation; autokinase; polymyxin resistance	E. coli K-12 Etk is de-phosphorylated by the Etp phosphatase in vitro (Vincent, 2000). E. coli K-12 does not produce O-antigen capsule polysaccharide because the cryptic gfcABCDE-etp-etk operon is silenced by IS1D in the promoter region (Peleg, 2005). Etk is required for O-antigen capsule formation in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (Peleg, 2005). Partial phosphorylation of Etk Y574 has been experimentally confirmed by using 3,5-difluorotyrosine as a 19 F NMR probe; a proposed interaction between Y574 and R614 was confirmed (Li, 2013). Etp Y121 is shown to be phosphorylated by an unknown kinase, not Etk or Wzc (Nadler, 2012). The Etk paralog Wzc is autophosphorylated intra-molecularly at Y569 and inter-molecularly at Y708, Y710, Y711, Y713 and Y715, as experimentally demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro kinase assays; all six phosphorylated Wzc tyrosines are conserved in Etk (Y574, Y713, Y715, Y717, Y718 and Y720 (Grangeasse, 2002). A crystal structure of Etk did not show tyrosine phosphates due to rapid dephosphorylation during the sample preparation; structure-guided mutagenesis with enzymatic and phenotypic characterization of the K-12 Etk kinase supports a proposed Y574-R614 interaction and molecular switching mechanism (Lee, 2008). Experimental evidence and molecular dynamics simulations support the molecular switch interaction between Y574 and R614 and also identifies R572 as influencing the rotation of P-Y574 (Lu, 2009). Like its paralog Wzc, Etk is a membrane-bound protein with two transmembrane segments flanking a short N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a large periplasmic domain, and a large C-terminal catalytic cytoplasmic domain (Doublet, 2002; Daley, 2005). The O-antigen capsule is also known as the group 4 capsule (G4C).
b0982	EG13727	etp	O-antigen capsule forming protein-tyrosine-phosphatase; Etk-P dephosphorylase	Enzyme; Not classified	Protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, required for O-antigen capsule formation; dephosphorylates Etk-P	E. coli K-12 Etk is de-phosphorylated by the Etp phosphatase in vitro (Vincent, 2000). E. coli K-12 does not produce O-antigen capsule polysaccharide because the cryptic gfcABCDE-etp-etk operon is silenced by IS1D in the promoter region (Peleg, 2005). Etp is required for O-antigen capsule formation in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (Peleg, 2005). Etp Y121 is phosphorylated by an unknown kinase, not Etk or Wzc, and can autodephosphorylate in vitro (Nadler, 2012). etp and wzb are paralogs. Etp can dephosphorylates Wzc-P and Wzb-P in vitro (Vincent, 2000). Etp belongs to the low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (LMWPc) family (Pfam PF01451).
b0983	EG13728	gfcE	putative O-antigen capsule outer membrane auxillary protein export channel	Transport; Not classified	Probable OMA family export channel; required to make O-antigen capsule; outer membrane auxillary lipoprotein	E. coli K-12 does not produce O-antigen capsule polysaccharide because the cryptic gfcABCDE-etp-etk operon is silenced by IS1D in the promoter region (Peleg, 2005). GfcE is required for O-antigen capsule formation in enteropathogenic (EPEC) E. coli strain O127:H6 and probably forms an OMA family polysaccharide export channel (Paulsen, 1997; Peleg, 2005). gfcE(yccZ) and wza are paralogs. GfcE structure and function is inferred by analogy with the Wza function translocating group 1 K30 capsular polysaccharide in E. coli E69 (O9a:K30) (Drummelsmith, 2000; Nesper, 2003; Beis, 2004; Reid, 2005; Dong, 2006). Since the outer membrane protein Wza interacts with the periplasmic domain of Wzc it is likely that GfcE associates with the Wzc paralog Etk (Nadler, 2012). The first 20 aa of GfcE are a type II signal peptide. otherPDB(E. coli K30): 2J58 (Dong, 2006). otherPDB(E. coli K30): 2W8H, 2W8I (Hagelueken, 2009).

GfcD is required for O-antigen capsule formation in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (Peleg, 2005). gfcD(ymcA) and yjbH are paralogs. GfcD has both type I (21 aa) and (slightly better) type II (18 aa) signal peptide predictions by SignalP/LipoP. GfcD is not likely to be a lipoprotein because the lipobox Cys is poorly conserved; many GfcD homologs that lack the essential lipidated Cys are nonetheless annotated as putative lipoproteins.

GfcC is required for O-antigen capsule formation in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (Peleg, 2005). yjbG and gfcC(ymcB) are paralogs. The first 22 aa of GfcC are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. Although the crystal structure of E. coli GfcC is from strain O127:H6, it has only four mismatches as compared to the K-12 GfcC (Sathiyamoorthy, 2011).

Overexpressed YdcY and DmsD interfere with apoTorA maturation by TorD, independent of the TorA signal peptide (Ilbert, 2004). Bifunctional TorD acts in MGD insertion and TorA export proof-reading, a step that insures only mature protein is exported. TorD has intrinsic GTPase activity in its domain-swapped homodimeric form (Guymer, 2010).

However, subsequent experiments found similar effects with BSA, concluding that WrbA does not influence TrpR-operator binding in vitro (Grandori, 1998). Although WrbA may affect the association between Trp repressor and operators in stationary phase in vivo (Yang, 1993), this may be a non-specific effect. EcoArray search results indicate that wrbA transcripts are altered by rpoS, relA, trpA and trpR mutations, among others. wrbA is repressed by OxyS overexpression (Tjaden, 2006). otherPDB: 1ZWL(P.aeruginosa).

The in vivo requirement for the RutF flavin reductase to regenerate FMN for RutA can be substituted for by Fre in vitro and by unknown genetic suppressors in vivo (Mukherjee, 2010; Kim, 2010).

In vivo, RutE is predicted to convert the toxic RutB product malonic semialdehyde (3-oxopropionic acid) into 3-hydroxypropionic acid, which is then excreted; and it is required for efficient growth using uridine as sole nitrogen source at 37C; RutE is presumably supplemented by the YdfG malonic semialdehyde reductase under these conditions since both are apparently required to detoxify malonic semialdehyde and allow for efficient growth; the uridine growth defects of both rutE and ydfG mutants can be suppressed by nemR mutations overproducing the NemA reductase (Kim, 2010). nfsA, nfsB, rutE, and ydjA are paralogs. NtrC regulon.
b1009	EG13856	rutD	putative reactive intermediate detoxifying aminoacrylate hydrolase	Enzyme; Pyrimidine nitrogen catabolism	Putative aminoacrylate hydrolase; reactive intermediate detoxification; required for pyrimidine nitrogen degradation in vivo but not in vitro	Constitutive derepression of the the rut operon (ntrB) is required for the utilization of thymidine, uridine and cytidine as nitrogen sources at 37C, but not at room temperature. The RutB product aminoacrylate peracid is reduced spontaneously to toxic aminoacrylate which spontaneously hydrolyzes to malonic semialdehyde in vitro; RutD is proposed to accelerate the hydrolysis of aminoacrylate in vivo to avoid toxicity (Kim, 2010). Since the enamine/imine deaminase RutC is now predicted to detoxify aminoacrylate, either RutC and RutD are two different ways to detoxify aminoacrylate, or one of them has a different substrate (Lambrecht, 2012). NtrC regulon.
b1010	EG13857	rutC	putative aminoacrylate deaminase, reactive intermediate detoxification; weak enamine/imine deaminase activity	Enzyme; Pyrimidine nitrogen catabolism	Putative aminoacrylate deaminase; trimeric; weak enamine/imine deaminase activity; reactive intermediate detoxification; required for pyrimidine nitrogen degradation in vivo but not in vitro	The RutB product aminoacrylate peracid is toxic and is reduced spontaneously to aminoacrylate, which then spontaneously hydrolyzes to malonic semialdehyde in vitro; the reaction intermediate deaminase RutC probably accelerates the deamination of aminoacrylate in vivo to avoid toxicity (Kim, 2010; Lambrecht, 2012). The Salmonella PF01042 family member RidA(YjgF) is an enamine/imine deaminase required in vivo for the detoxification of reactive intermediates of the PLP-dependent threonine/serine dehydratase IlvA, releasing ammonia in a hydrolysis reaction indicative of the low water environment of the cell; RutC has weak enamine/imine deaminase activity as measured by an increased initial rate of IlvA-catalyzed 2-ketobutyrate formation in vitro using either threonine or serine as substrate; the weak reaction of RutC as compared to other RidA homologs is likely due to relatively low sequence similarity and use of a non-native substrate (Lambrecht, 2012). RidA(YjgF), RutC, TdcF, YoaB and YjgH are paralogs and members of a highly conserved RidA(YjgF) family (pfam:PF01042) with diverse mutant phenotypes; the family members form homotrimers, some binding 2-ketoglutarate or related compounds, and all are probably reactive intermediate deaminases. Constitutive derepression of the the rut operon (ntrB) is required for the utilization of thymidine, uridine and cytidine as nitrogen sources at 37C, but not at room temperature. The structure of RutC from E. coli O6 has been determined and is 100% identical to the K-12 RutC sequence (Knapik, 2012). The rat homolog PSP (perchloric acid-soluble protein) has been reported to have endoribonuclease activity, Endoribonuclease L, against ss mRNA, inhibiting translation. NtrC regulon.

RutB probably hydrolyzes the RutA product ureidoacrylate peracid quickly in vivo to avoid toxicity, but can also hydrolyze any ureidoacrylate that is formed spontaneously; the RutB product aminoacrylate peracid is also toxic and is reduced spontaneously to aminoacrylate which spontaneously hydrolyzes to malonic semialdehyde in vitro; RutC and/or RutD may accelerate aminoacrylate hydrolysis in vivo to avoid toxicity (Kim, 2010; Lambrecht, 2012).

RutA cleaves pyrmidine rings directly by adding oxygen atoms, making a toxic ureidoacrylate peracid product which can be spontaneously reduced to ureidoacrylate; RutB probably hydrolyzes ureidoacrylate peracid quickly in vivo to avoid toxicity, and can also hydrolyze any ureidoacrylate that is formed spontaneously; the in vivo requirement for the RutF flavin reductase to regenerate FMN for RutA can be substituted for by Fre in vitro and by unknown genetic suppressors in vivo (Mukherjee, 2010; Kim, 2010).

b1018	EG13861	efeO	inactive ferrous ion transporter EfeUOB	Null	Inactive acid-inducible low-pH ferrous ion transporter EfeUOB; acid-inducible periplasmic protein	The EfeUOB tripartite iron transporter is silent in E. coli K-12 due to a mutation in EfeU (Cao, 2007). efeO(ycdO) has been reported to be both an essential gene (DeVito, 2002) and non-essential (Baba, 2006). The Tat-targeting of EfeO(YcdO) translocation could not be assessed (Tullman-Ercek, 2007). The first 26 aa of efeO have been confirmed to be a type I signal peptide by electrospray MS of the intact periplasmic protein (Sturm, 2006). efeUOB of K-12 are transcribed as an iron-depletion-inducible, Fur-dependent operon (McHugh, 2003; Grosse, 2006). EfeO(YcdO) protein levels increased after 30 min of Zn(II) stress (Easton, 2006). Mutations in efeO have a hyperlethality phenotype when cells are stressed; EfeO is a protein that reduces the lethal effects of stress (Han, 2010).

The acquisition of iron from exogenous heme when the foreign heme receptor HasR is expressed is reduced in an efeB or yfeX single mutant and eliminated in an efeB yfeX double mutant; overproduced EfeB complements a yfeX mutation, indicating some cytoplasmic activity of EfeB; the Dpp dipeptide/heme permease is required since the utilization of iron extracted from heme by EfeB in the periplasm requires an active EfeUOB iron transporter; iron is extracted without rupturing the tetrapyyrol ring; EfeB and YfeX facilitate the conversion of heme to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) (Letoffe, 2009). The EfeUOB tripartite iron transporter is silent in E. coli K-12 due to a mutation in EfeU (Cao, 2007). False positive lipoprotein prediction, Cys not conserved. Verified Tat substrate: EfeB has a Tat/Sec (Class II) 35 aa signal peptide (Tullman-Ercek, 2007). The first 35 aa of EfeB have been confirmed as a type I signal peptide by electrospray MS of the intact periplasmic protein (Sturm, 2006). efeUOB of K-12 are transcribed as an iron-depletion-inducible, Fur-dependent operon (McHugh, 2003; Grosse, 2006). yfeX and efeB are paralogs and representatives of the DyP-type peroxidase family.

Full induction of pgaD requires c-di-GMP specifically produced by DgcZ(YdeH) (Boehm, 2009). pgaD complements a mutation in the homologous Y. pestis hemin storage gene hmsS. CsrA regulon.

PgaC complements a mutation in the homologous Y. pestis hemin storage gene hmsR. Two predicted transmembrane domains at the N-terminus and three at the C-terminus may anchor PgaC, which has a large central, possibly periplasmic, domain. CsrA regulon.

PgaB is homologous to Y. pestis hemin storage protein HmsF, but is unable to complement hmsF mutations. The first 20 aa of PgaB constitute a type II signal peptide. CsrA regulon. Poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA), is a biofilm adhesin polysaccharide also abbreviated as PNAG.

b1025	EG13866	ycdT	diguanylate cyclase, membrane-anchored	Null	Diguanylate cyclase, membrane-anchored	YcdT mRNA is translationally repressed by CsrA (Jonas, 2008). ycdT overexpression causes a 20-fold increase in c-di-GMP and represses motility, but a mutant has little effect (Jonas, 2008). The results of Jonas (2008) might indicate that although the c-di-GMP spike inhibits motility it is not known if this is the normal function of the overproduced diguanylate cyclase or if the overexpression induced non-physiological crosstalk. YcdT is homologous to Y. pestis hemin storage gene hmsT, but is unable to complement hmsT mutations. YcdT has been shown not to be a regulator of the divergent pgaABCD operon. Codon usage indicates ycdT is an alien (horizontal) gene. YcdT has an N-terminal integral membrane domain with 8 predicted TM helices reminiscent of the MASE TM signaling domains in other c-di-GMP enzymes. YcdT has a C-terminal diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain.

The YcdX structure reveals a trinuclear zinc active site. Like Pol III alpha (DnaE), YcdX has a PHP domain. YcdY and YcdX are required for swarming; YcdY binds to YcdX and increases the alkaline phosphatase activity of YcdX after denaturation and in the presence of zinc, although YcdY does not bind zinc itself (Redelberger; 2011).

b1037	EG13413	csgG	curli production assembly/transport outer membrane lipoprotein	Structural component; Surface structures	Pore-forming OM lipoprotein for curli subunit secretion; CsgEFG curlin secretion complex	CsgG is the pore-forming subunit of the CsgEFG outer membrane secretion complex for exporting CsgA and CsgB; the first 20 amino acids of the mature CsgA curlin (residues 21-40) are sufficient to target heterologous proteins the the CsgEFG secretion complex (Robinson, 2006). CsgG alone can form outer membrane pores when over-expressed that lack specificity and directionality, leaking out small periplasmic proteins and making cells sensitive (permeable) to external erythromycin; co-expresssion of CsgE with CsgG produces curlin-specific export channels that require a 22 amino acid OM secretion signal from CsgA or, presuambly, CsgB for secretion; CsgE binds to and prevents the premature subunit assembly of curlin CsgA into amyloid fibers (Neninger, 2011). Overexpression causes abnormal biofilm architecture. The first 15 aa of CsgG are a type II signal peptide.

Overexpression of csgF causes abnormal biofilm architecture. The predicted 19 aa signal peptide of CsgF is consistent with an observed secB-dependent precursor cleavage that is blocked by azide (Marani, 2006).

SignalP analysis is consistent with CsgC having an uncleaved signal anchor which may be subsequently cleaved by an intramembrane or periplasmic protease. Alternatively, the csgC signal peptide may be a valid type I signal peptide that is anomalous and was not represented in the SignalP training set.

Full activity of ClsC requires co-expression in the same clone with the upstream gene ymdB; ClsC expression alone or clsC and ymdB expresssion from separate plasmids produces only small amounts of cardiolipin; YmdB is suggested to be a stimulatory subunit of a two-component cardiolipin synthase (Tan, 2012). An alternative explanation for the need to co-express ymdB with clsC to get full ClsC activity may be an obligatory translational coupling of ymdB and clsC needed to get efficient translation using the ClsC TTG start codon (K.E.R.) YmdB binds directly to RNase III (Kim, 2008). Pfam PF01661 family. UPF0189 family. RpoS regulon.

Three paralogous cls genes encoding cardiolipin synthases, clsA(cls), clsB(ybhO) and clsC(ymdC), need to be deleted in order to prevent in vivo cardiolipin synthesis; most studies on the effects of cardiolipin depletion only used clsA(cls) mutant strains that still sythesize cardiolipin (Tan, 2012). Full activity of ClsC requires co-expression in the same clone with the upstream gene ymdB; ClsC expression alone or clsC and ymdB expresssion from separate plasmids produces only small amounts of cardiolipin; YmdB is suggested to be a stimulatory subunit of a two-component cardiolipin synthase (Tan, 2012). An alternative explanation for the need to co-express ymdB with clsC to get full ClsC activity may be an obligatory translational coupling of ymdB and clsC needed to get efficient translation using the ClsC TTG start codon (K.E.R.) ClsC utilizes a novel mechanism for cardiolipin synthesis in that phosphatidylethanolamine is used as the phosphatidyl donor to phosphatidylglycerol to form cardiolipin; mutating the two conserved phospholipase D superfamily motifs oblated ClsC activity (Tan, 2012).

b1056	EG11820	yceI	periplasmic high pH-inducible lipid-binding protein	Null	Periplasmic high pH-inducible lipid-binding protein; dimeric	YceI was found in the periplasmic protein fraction and N-terminal sequencing demonstrated that a 22 amino acid signal peptide is cleaved from YceI (Link, 1997). The yceJI operon promoter region has an ArcA binding site (Federowicz, 2014). E. coli yceI is induced by high pH (Stancik, 2002). E. coli yceI is induced by NaCl osmotic stress (Weber, 2006). The E. coli YceI crystal structure includes a bound 2-octaprenylphenol molecule in a lipocalin-like fold (PDB: 1Y0G). Two yceI family members from B. cenocepacia, BCAL3310 and BCAL3311, encode secreted proteins that bind to polymixin B and confer resistance and heteroresistance (El-Halfawy, 2013). A crystal structure of the T. thermophilus YceI family member TT1927b has a bound polyprenyl pyrophosphate molecule; structure comparisons indicate that although structurally similar to OmpA YceI family proteins are not outer membrane proteins but are soluble proteins with hydrophobic cores binding lipid molecules (Handa, 2005). A crystal structure of the H. pylori YceI family member HP1286, which is low pH-inducible and secreted out to the medium, has a bound polyprenyl pyrophosphate molecule (Sisinni, 2010). The P. syringae PSPPH_4050-encoded YceI-like protein crystal structure includes a bound ubiquinone-8 molecule (PDB: 3Q34). The predicted presence of an antiparallel beta-barrel in YceI has led to its mischaracterization as an outer membrane protein (Yan, 2014).

The physiological substrate for SolA is unknown. Cys308 of SolA is the probable FAD attachment site. Mass spectral analysis gives an observed MW of 41684 daltons. FAD-SolA holoenzyme MW is predicted as 41688, indicating the sequence and start codon is correct and that the initial Met is not clipped.

b1069	EG13880	murJ	putative lipid II flippase	Putative factor; Not classified	Putative lipid II flippase; required for murein synthesis	Inactivation of MurJ in vivo, but not FtsW, blocks lipid II translocation (Sham, 2014). Overproduced FtsW but not overproduced MurJ increases lipid II translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane in crude reconstituted vesicles (Mohammadi, 2011). Both FtsW and MurJ are involved in lipid II translocation but which one is the actual flippase is controversial with conflicting in vivo and in vitro results; the in vitro results utilize crude membrane vesicles that also contain MurJ, which may not be limiting; the in vivo results do not demonstrate flippase activity directly and FtsW inactivation could be incomplete, so one of the two proteins could be stimulating the other which has the flippase activity; MurJ is related to known flippase exporters and FtsW is not, suggesting that MurJ may indeed be the actual flippase (Young, 2014). murJ(yceN) is an essential gene and conditional lethal mutants swell, burst and accumulate the murein intermediate polyprenyl diphosphate-N-acetylmuramic acid-(pentapeptide)-N-acetyl-glucosamine at the non-permissive temperature (Inoue, 2008). murJ(yceN) was identified as one of two ORFs adjacent to the flg locus in a region originally named mviS, then renamed mviN and mviM when sequenced; mviMN was thought to be required for mouse virulence in Salmonella, but the mviMN deletion in ST39 also removed flgM (Carsiotis, 1989). flgM was later shown to be able to complement the mviS phenotype, and thus flgM is the real mouse virulence gene in this region of the Salmonella chromosome not mviS (Schmitt, 1994).

FlgM is characterized primarily in Salmonella; the fMet of Salmonella FlgM is clipped. yceN was identified as one of two ORFs adjacent to the flg locus in a region originally named mviS, then renamed mviN and mviM when sequenced; mviMN was thought to be required for mouse virulence in Salmonella, but the mviMN deletion in ST39 also removed flgM (Carsiotis, 1989). flgM was later shown to be able to complement the mviS phenotype, and thus flgM is the real mouse virulence gene mviS in this region of the Salmonella chromosome (Schmitt, 1994).

The N-terminal rod-binding domain (Pfam PF10135) of FlgJ is required for rod assembly (Minamino, 1999; Hirano, 2001). The C-terminal domain of FlgJ is required for the autolysin activity that facilitates the rod assembly function of the N-terminal domain but the activity was misinterpreted as a murein hydrolase (Dijkstra, 1996; Nambu, 1999; Hirano, 2001).

S. pneumoniae PlsX and PlsY work together as a two-step glycerol-3-phosphate acylation, the first step in phosphatidic acid synthesis, an intermediate in phospholipid synthesis (Lu, 2006). PlsXY homologs are present in E. coli, but PlsXY cannot substitute for the single step reaction catalyzed by the essential PlsB even on plasmids, although S. pneumoniae plsXY can plasmid rescue E. coli plsB null mutants (Yoshimura, 2007). plsY(ygiH) and plsX are synthetic lethals and cannot be simultaneously deleted and plsB overexpression permits growth of the plsXY double mutant (Yoshimura, 2007). A plsB null mutation cannot be P1 transduced into a strain with a chromosomal plsX mutation containing a plsB Km missense mutant clone which does allow growth of a plsB null mutation in a plsX+ background (Yoshimura, 2007).

HinT hydrolyzes lysyl-AMP, an activity that may be involved in the regulation of translation or the scavanging of aminoacyl-adenylates (Chou, 2006). hinT is essential for growth under high salt conditions (Chou, 2005). HinT is a member of the HIT (histidine triad) family that contains Ap3A and Ap4A hydrolases. HinT is a low abundance protein.

b1120	EG13443	cobB	deacetylase of acs and cheY, chemotaxis regulator	Null	Protein lysine deacetylase, NAD(+)-dependent; chemotaxis regulator; protein lysine desuccinylase; sirituin homolog	In addition to its activity as a protein lysine deacetylase, CobB has protein lysine desuccinylase activity (Colak, 2013). NhoA is acetylated at Lys214 and at the C-terminal Lys281; NhoA is deacetylated by CobB, acetylation and deacytylation affects NhoA activity (Zhang, 2013). RcsB is acetylated at Lys180 by Pka(YfiQ) in vitro blocking its ability to bind to DNA, and Lys180 is deacetylated by CobB in vitro (Thao, 2010). Acetyl CoA synthase Acs is activated by CobB-mediated deacetylation of K609 in Salmonella (Starai, 2002). E. coli CobB deacetylates the Acs K609 peptide in vitro (Zhao, 2004). Protein acetyltransferase in Salmonella inhibits acetyl CoA synthase Acs by acetylating residue K609 (Starai, 2004). More than 100 proteins have acetylated lysines in E. coli (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2008). CobB may have a limited role in general protein lysine deacetylation since only four protein bands were changed in an E. coli cobB mutant (Zhang, 2008). cobB is named after its Salmonella ortholog and has no known cobalamin function in E. coli. CobB can deacetylate CheY in vitro and in vivo, reducing FliM binding and chemotaxis (Li, 2010). cobB is a mutational phenotypic suppressor of a cheA cheZ double mutation (Li, 2010). CobB has been reported to have a weak protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, although this was subsequently refuted (Frye, 1999; Landry, 2000). CobB can catalyze an NAD-nicotinamide exchange reaction, which is dependent on the presence of acetyllysine, alone or in proteins, indicative of formation of an enzyme-ADP-ribose intermediate during the NAD-dependent deacetylation reaction (Landry, 2000). The CobB start has been moved up to Met-38, removing 37 aa that are not conserved, however verification is required because the upstream start has a good RBS and might be utilized in E. coli if transcribed (Maillet, 2007).

This icd allele has a C-terminus added during prophage e14 integration at codon 362, introducing 2 amino acid changes in icd. icdC' encodes the original C-terminus of icd. Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). Icd lysines K100 and K242 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011). Icd lysines K142, K177, K230, K235, K242, K265 and K378 can be modified to N6-acetyllysine (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2009). Modification of Icd K100 and K242 to succinyllysine, as well as K230 to acetyllysine in stationary phase, may affect Icd activity since those residues are critical for activity and substate binding (Lee, 1995; Bolduc, 1995; Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2011). Icd has tellurite reductase branch activity and and an icd mutant is tellurite-sensitive (Reinoso, 2013).

b1139	EG10535	lit	T4 phage exclusion protein; cell death peptidase, e14 prophage	Membrane; Phage or Prophage Related	T4 phage exclusion protein; cell death peptidase, e14 prophage	Constitutive expression of the e14 prophage gene lit by a promoter-up mutation blocks late T4 gene expression causing T4 phage exclusion (Cooley, 1979; Kao, 1987; Kao, 1988). Lit-mediated T4 phage exclusion depends upon translation of the gol (growth on lit) region of the T4 capsid gene 23 to make a polypeptide segment that binds to EF-Tu and enables EF-Tu proteolysis by Lit between residues Gly60 and Ile61, causing global inhibition of translation and cell death prior to the translation of late genes and production of T4 virions, blocking viral transmission (Bergsland, 1990; Yu, 1994; Georgiou, 1998; Bingham, 2000; Copeland, 2004). Overproduced Lit protein is enriched in mini-cell inner membrane fractions (Kao, 1998). The mode of Lit protein inner membrane binding is uncertain because the prediction of transmembrane domains for Lit is ambiguous as zero, one and two transmembrane domains have been variously predicted, but generally most programs do not predict any transmembrane domains. The known substrate for Lit proteolysis, EF-Tu, is located in the cytoplasm.

Purified McrA specifically binds to but does not cut HpaII methylated DNA; McrA mediates in vivo restriction of 5-methyl and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine DNA at the specific DNA sequence C(m)CGG, but the mechanism is unclear since no in vitro DNA nuclease activity of McrA has been detected (Mulligan, 2008). A detailed analysis defined the McrA binding site as N(Y>R)m(5)CGR (Mulligan, 2010). McrA contains an intact C-terminal HNH nuclease domain (Pfam01844) and McrA may have nuclease activity in vivo, or it may have an unidentified partner nuclease protein. McrA has been predicted to be a polymorphic toxin (Zhang, 2012).

BluR(YcgE) has a MerR-like HTH DNA binding domain. BluR(YcgE) and its blue light-responsive anti-represssor BluF(YcgF) control a regulon of eight small proteins, including the RcsBCD activators YmgAB (Tschowri, 2009).

AriR(YmgA) mediates the 5-fluorouracil represssion of biofilm formation (Attila, 2009). Blue light activation of the BluF(YgcF) anti-repressor relieves BluR(YcgE) repression of the cold-shock RpoS-activated small protein operon ycgZ-ymgA-ariR-ymgC operon; connector proteins AirR(YmgB) (at 28C) and YmgA (at 16C) stimulate colanic acid synthesis and inhibit curli production by an RcsA-independent activation of RcsB; RcsB activation is antagonized by connector protein YcgZ (Tschowri, 2009). AirR(YmgB) stimulates acid resistance genes (Tschowri, 2009). AirR(YmgB), YmgA and YcgZ are connector proteins, small proteins which influence the activity of specific two-component systems (Tschowri, 2009). AriR may be a dimeric DNA binding protein. AriR is blue light, low temperature and stress inducible and in the BluRF(YcgEF) and RpoS regulons.

The membrane localization of MinD is mediated by an 8-12 residue C-terminal motif, the membrane targeting sequence (MTS), mutations in this region prevent membrane localization, but not MinC binding. MinD contains switch I and II regions (regions that undergo nucleotide-dependent conformational changes responsible for interactions with their partners) involved in MinC interactions. MinCD oscillates (migrates) between coating one half of the cell's membrane (minE ring to pole) to coating the other half every 40 secs, and this may help to identify the cell center. Overexpression of MinD causes filamentous biofilm formation. MinCD forms membrane-associated coiled arrays on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membranewhich are more concentrated at the poles.

Uncleaved UmuD(2)C is a DNA damage checkpoint effector that can delay replication restart until it is converted into Pol V (Opperman, 1999; Murli, 2000; Ferentz, 2001). Pol V has intrinsic AP lyase activity (Chen, 2005). Trans-autocleavage of an UmuD homodimer subunit by the other UmuD subunit, triggered by the UmuD dimer binding to a ssDNA-RecA complex, removes the first 24 amino acids to form UmuD' which is required for mutageneic translesion synthesis (TLS) (Shinagawa, 1988; Nohmi, 1988; Burckhardt, 1988; Shiba, 1990; Woodgate, 1991; Bailone, 1991; Lee, 1996; McDonald, 1998; Opperman, 1999; Sutton, 2001). UmuD and UmuD' are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that can nonetheless form stable dimers (Simon, 2008). Pol V is a RecA-ssDNA binding protein (Frank, 1993). The RecA-ssDNA complex, a nucleoprotein filament, is required for PolV translesion bypass synthesis (Reuven, 2001). The active form of PolV is UmuD'(2)C-RecA-ATP (Jiang, 2009). Because Pol V (UmuD'(2)C) is mutagenic it is regulated by UmuD autocleavage activation to UmuD' and by Lon and ClpXP-mediated regulated degradation of UmuC, UmuD, and UmuD'; UmuD' is targeted for ClpXP-mediated degradation by the UmuD protein in the UmuDD' dimer, leaving UmuD intact; UmuD and UmuC are degraded by Lon (Frank, 1996; Gonzalez, 1998; Gonzalez, 2000).

Although prfA is essential in K-12 strains, prfA can be deleted in E. coli strains with wildtype prfB function, either non-K-12 strains or K-12 strains with the repair of the presumably laboratory-acquired A246T point mutation in prfB (Johnson, 2011; Johnson, 2012; Ohtake, 2012). The K-12 prfB A246T mutation lowers the release activity of RF2 for UAA by five-fold (Uno, 1996; Dincbas-Renqvist, 2000). prfA can be deleted in MG1655 when 321 UAG stop codons are reassigned to UAA stop codons (Lajoie, 2013).

Presumably the poor growth of a K-12 prmC(hemK) deletion mutant could also be alleviated by repairing the stop codon mutation in the rpsG gene of K-12 (Dreyfus, 2011). prmC(hemK) was originally isolated as a suppressor of the light sensitivity of hemH, now likely to be an indirect effect.

b1234	EG12120	rssA	putative patatin-like family phospholipase	Null	Predicted phospholipase, patatin-like family, function unknown	The patatin-like family (also known as the NTE family) pfam01734 contains proteins with a predicted phospholipase domain. YjjU and RssA(YchK) are distant homologs of the pfam01734 superfamily; RssA (COG1752 family) appears to be a core gene while YjjU (COG4667 family) appears to be a horizontal transfer. A previous report of unpublished data reporting an rssA mutant has elevated RpoS levels is due to polarity on rssB (Muffler, 1996; Ruiz, 2001).
b1235	EG12121	rssB	PcnB-degradosome interaction factor; response regulator	Regulator; Basic proteins - synthesis, modification	Response regulator binding RpoS to initiate proteolysis by ClpXP; required for the PcnB-degradosome interaction during stationary phase; major cognate sensor kinase is ArcB	The protyolysis initiated by RssB binding to RpoS is inhibited by three anti-RssB anti-adaptor proteins IraP, IraM, and IraD in response to different stresses (Bougdour, 2006; Bougdour, 2008). RssB and ArcA are both phosphorylated by the ArcA sensor histidine protein kinase as part of a three-component system (Mika, 2005). RssB-initiated protyolysis of RpoS does not require the RssB response regulator phosphorylation site (Peterson, 2004). A yliE rssB9(hnr) double null mutant has significantly increased lycopene production in 1X M9; the effect may be salt-suppressible as it is not seen in 2X M9 (Alper, 2008). RssB is not a transcriptional regulator and does not have a DNA-binding domain typical of most response regulators. RssB(SprE) is required to maintain the association of PcnB with the degradosome during stationary phase (Carabetta, 2010).

b1336	EG12853	abgT	p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate transporter; membrane protein	Putative transport; Not classified	p-Aminobenzoyl-glutamate transporter; membrane protein	Artificial expression of abgT allows the uptake of p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate (Hussein, 1998; Carter, 2007). abgAB expression catalyzes the p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate assimilation to feed p-aminobenzoate auxotrophs (Carter, 2007). The abg operon is silent and an AbgR inducer has not been found, suggesting another natural substrate (Hussein, 1998; Carter, 2007). IT (Ion Transporter) superfamily (Prakash, 2003).

AbgAB (PGH) catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate to p-aminobenzoate (Carter, 2007; Green, 2010). The abg operon is silent and an AbgR inducer has not been found (Hussein, 1998; Carter, 2007). AbgB is a member of the M20 peptidase family. abgA and abgB are paralogs. AbgABT does not degrade dipeptides; the physiological role of abgABT should be clarified when the inducer for AbgR is elucidated (Green, 2010).

AbgAB (PGH) catalyzes the hydrolysis of folate metabolite p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate to p-aminobenzoate (Carter, 2007; Green, 2010). The abg operon is silent and an AbgR inducer has not been found (Hussein, 1998; Carter, 2007). AbgA is a member of the M20 peptidase family. abgA and abgB are paralogs.

b1340	EG13354	smrA	DNA endonuclease	Null	DNA endonuclease, function unknown	SmrA(YdaL) has DNA endonuclease activity (Gui, 2011). The two E. coli Smr proteins were identified and named smr based on homology to the C-terminal domain of MutS2 which has an N-terminal domain homologous to MutS but is not found in E. coli; mutS2 is usually found only in strains lacking smr genes (Moreira, 1999). Although the mnemonic for Smr is small mutS-related, mutS2-related is used since the Smr proteins do not have a region homologous to MutS itself.
b1341	EG13355	ydaM	diguanylate cyclase, csgD regulator	Null	Diguanylate cyclase, csgD regulator; also regulates GGDEF protein YaiC(AdrA)	YdaM has an N-terminal PAS domain with a second PAS domain followed by a PAC domain then a C-terminal diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain; there may be a degenerate PAC structural domain between the first and second PAS domains since PAC domains are usually associated C-terminal to PAS domains. RpoS regulon (Weber, 2006). YdaM expression is thermoregulated and may act as a thermosensor for curli control (Weber, 2006). YdaM/Gmr(YciR) constitute an RpoS-regulated c-di-GMP synthesis/degradation module inversely regulated by Hns and controlling the expression of curli genes (Weber, 2006). YdaM has diguanylate cyclase activity in vitro (Weber, 2006).

TtcA has been shown to be required for the formation of 2-thiocytidine s(2)C32 in Salmonella and E. coli (Jager, 2004). 2-thiocytidine s(2)C32 is present in three Arg tRNAs (CCG, UCU, ICG) and in Ser tRNA(GCU). The attachment site of Rac is a 26 bp repeat region flanking Rac: 1409923-1409948 and 1432983-1433008 (A. J. Clark, pers. comm., June, 1998). The ends of Rac are marked at the left end of these repeat regions to delineate attB and attP. This Rac integration event is within the ttcA gene; the first 17 aa of TtcA are Rac prophage-derived. The ttcC' pseudogene is the remnant 17 aa displaced from the original chromosomal ttcA gene. 25 bp encoding four mismatches immediately preceed the 26 bp exact repeat. Representative of both alleles are found in sequenced E. coli and Shigell genomes. This is analogous to e14 integration into the icd gene producing the icdC' remnant pseudogene.

The RcbA phenotype might be due to expression of the RalA sRNA antitoxin encoded on the opposite strand as ydaC; the RalR protein is a DNase toxin (Guo, 2014). ydaC does appear to encode a conserved DUF1187 family protein of unknown function (Pfam PF06688); until it is determined whether or not RalA, and presumably RalR, are involved in the DnaA-induced dsDNA breaks, and whether or not the putative YdaC protein is involved, rbcA is changed back to ydaC and rbcA is added as a synonym to both ydaC and ralA.

YdaG matches Pfam PF14555 (UBA_4) and the InterPro IPR009060 (UBA-like) profile (which is derived from the Superfamily SSF46934 profile) indicating that YdaG consists of a single UBA-like domain; UBA is a ubiquitin associated domain that is often involved in binding ubiquitin; the UBA, UBA-like, and RuvA C-terminal domain all belong to the UBA-like Pfam clan CL0214. ydaG was identified in a personal communication of unpublished DNA sequence (2527 bp) and annotation from A.J. Clark, H. Samra, J. Li, C.C. Chu, C.S. Laufer and J.B. Hays, November, 1993. DNA sequence revised (2527 bp), June, 1996.

SapD(TrkE) is required for TrkAH activity and stimulates TrkAG transport rate (Bossemeyer, 1989; Dosch, 1991; Harms, 2001). TrkAG may be inactive during anaerobic growth (Trchounian, 1994). Trk-mediated transport is driven by proton motive force, but requires a high ATP concentration for maximal activity, presumably because ATP-binding is needed to activate SapD (Harms, 2001).

The 349 nt preceding ynaE is 98% identical to the ydfK 5' UTR thermosensor with only six mismatches and therefore the ynaE and ydfK 5' UTRs are probably isofunctional thermosensors.

b1378	EG13183	pfo	pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase	Pfo(YdbK) has pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase activity in vivo and in vitro; the in vitro activity is oxygen-labile; pfo(ydbK) is superoxide- and methyl violet(MV)-inducible; pfo(ydbK) mutants are sensitive to MV, synergistically with fpr mutants, indicating a role in protection from oxidative stress; in vitro binding and mutational studies identify a SoxS binding site centered near -100 upstream from the pfo(ydbK) start codon (Nakayama, 2013). The operonic pfo(ydbK) and ompN genes are activated by SoxS; pfo(ydbK) mutants are paraquat sensitive in minimal medium (F��brega, 2012). pfo(ydbK) deletion reduces and Pfo(YdbK) overexpression enhances hydrogen production in an engineered strain (Akhtar, 2009). Pfo(YdbK) is probably the CoA-acetylating pyruvate:flavodoxin (ferredoxin) oxidoreductase previously purified and characterized (Blaschkowski, 1982). 2/82 Pfo(YdbK) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). Pfo(YdbK) is 48% identical (569/1183) to NifJ of K. pneumoniae and has two predicted iron-sulfur clusters: 680-709 and 736-765. Pfo(YdbK) has a C-terminal domain and an N-terminal domain predicted to be involved in binding the TPP (thiamine pyrophosphate) cofactor.

b1381	EG13180	ydbH	putative membrane-anchored protein, function unknown	Null	Putative membrane-anchored protein	YdbH has been extensively mislabeled as a dicarboxylate transport family protein due to misannotations in three database profiles, namely Pfam PF11739, CDD cl14674, and InterPro IPR021730. YdbH has no similarities to any Dct transporters and is not predicted to be an integral membrane protein, although it does have a predicted N-terminal membrane anchor. The mislabeling of E. coli YdbH predicted function has arisen because the ygene naming systems for E. coli and B. subtilus, widely propagated to other Gram (-) and Gram (+) genomes, respectively, were developed independently and have many ygenes of the same name but share no homologous or functional relationships; the original ygene name for B. subtilus dctA was ydbH.

b1452	EG13775	yncE	ATP-binding protein, periplasmic, function unknown	Putative factor; Not classified	DNA-binding, ATP-binding periplasmic protein, function unknown	The first 30 aa of YncE are a type I signal peptide. yncE is repressed by Fe(2+)-Fur (McHugh, 2003). ATP-binding stabilizes YncE (Liu, 2011). YncE is a SecB-dependent secreted periplasmic protein that accumulates in the cytoplasm as an uncleaved precursor in a secB mutant (Baars, 2006). The beta-propellar structure of YncE may have led to a false prediction of YncE as a beta-barrel outer membrane protein (Zhai, 2002). YncE has a seven-bladed beta-propellar structure; YncE binds ssDNA better than dsDNA (Kagawa, 2011). Other beta-propellar WD40 repeat proteins include heme-binding oxidoreductases which may have led to a unsupported prediction that YncE is an oxidoreductase. YncE binds ATP and ssDNA, both of which are in short supply in the periplasm, making a functional prediction difficult; YncE has been suggested to be involved in iron transport since yncE is adjacent to the fhuA paralog yncD; perhaps YncE is a periplasmic binding protein facilitating the uptake of a novel iron ferrichrome that resembles ATP and ssDNA and that the binding of ATP and ssDNA is not physiologically relavent. ArcA binds in the yncE-yncD divergent promoter region and ArcA represses yncE and yncD expression (Federowicz, 2014).

b1489	EG13792	dosP	oxygen sensor, c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, heme-regulated; cold- and stationary phase-induced bioflim regulator	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Heme-regulated oxygen sensor, c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase; biofilm regulator; may have weak cAMP PDE activity; cold- and stationary phase-inducible; dimeric; dual domain protein; defective cyclase domain	DosCP regulates biofilm formation through the oxygen-dependent activation of the csgBAC operon (Tagliabue, 2010a). DosCP may constitute a cyclic-di-GMP synthesis/degradation module (Mendez-Ortiz, 2006; Tuckerman, 2009). Dos has been renamed as DosP (Tuckerman, 2009). The EAL domain of DosP has been shown to be a c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase and does not have significant cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, in contrast to an earlier report (Sasakura, 2002; Schmidt, 2005). cAMP hydrolysis by full length DosP found by Sasakura (2002) is three orders of magnitude slower than the rate of c-di-GMP hydrolysis, may not be physiologically relevant, and may be due to the use of 2'-O-anthraniloyl-cAMP instead of cAMP as substrate (Schmidt, 2005). Contrary to previous reports of a DosP tetramer (based on gel filtration), full-length DosP is a dimer in solution (Lechauve, 2009). Redox changes in the bound heme result in global 3D structural alterations; this "scissor-type" subunit movement aids in catalytic control. DosP contains 2 N-terminal heme binding PAS domains, a central defective GGDEF domain, and a C-terminal EAL domain. The start codon might be 8 codons upstream. dosP expression is elevated under aerobic conditions where it is partially responsible for cAMP degradation. The heme binding domain has been referred to as DosH. Asp40 of DosP is involved in the electronic structure of the haem iron and redox-dependent catalytic control of the PDE domain because mutations in Asp40 result in lack of catalytic activity. A dosP mutant is reported to have elevated cAMP under aerobic conditions, but this may be an indirect effect or it may reflect a physiologically relevant cAMP PDE activity in vivo. dosCP is an operon and DosCP is a protein complex (Tuckerman, 2009). 
b1490	EG13793	dosC	diguanylate cyclase, cold- and stationary phase-induced oxygen-dependent biofilm regulator	Null	Diguanylate cyclase, binds oxygen, positive biofilm regulator; cold- and stationary phase-induced	DosCP regulates biofilm formation through the oxygen-dependent activation of the csgBAC operon (Tagliabue, 2010a). DosCP may constitute a cyclic-di-GMP synthesis/degradation module (Mendez-Ortiz, 2006; Tuckerman, 2009). Overexpression of DosC(YddV), but not other DGCs, up-regulates the pgaABCD operon and biofilm formation independently of CsrA, and a dosC(yddV) mutant has reduced pgaABCD expression (Tagliabue, 2010b). Overexpressed DosC(YddV) complements R. leguminosarum celR mutants to produce cellulose and enhances cellulose production in A. tumefaciens. DosC(YddV) can complement Salmonella adrA. DosC(YddV) has an N-terminal GCSD(Globin-Coupled-Sensor Domain) that binds oxygen (Tuckerman, 2009). DosC(YddV) has a C-terminal diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain. dosCP is an operon and DosCP is a protein complex (Tuckerman, 2009). DosC(YddV) has been mislabeled as YhcK, the name of a B. subtilis homolog of YedQ. RpoS regulon (Weber, 2006).

Full induction of pgaD requires c-di-GMP specifically produced by DgcZ(YdeH) (Boehm, 2009). DgcZ(YdeH) mRNA is translationally repressed by CsrA (Jonas, 2008). DgcZ(YdeH) overexpression causes a 20-fold increase in c-di-GMP and represses motility, but a dgcZ(ydeH) mutant has little effect (Jonas, 2008). The results of Jonas (2008) might indicate that although the c-di-GMP spike inhibits motility it is not known if this is the normal function of the overproduced diguanylate cyclase or if the overexpression induced non-physiological crosstalk. DgcZ(YdeH) has an N-terminal MCP-signal associated domain (PF13682) that is often C-terminal to an MCP-signal domain (PF00015) not found in DgcZ(YdeH) family proteins but may be indicative of a physiological role in chemotaxis or motility; DgcZ(YdeH) has a C-terminal diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain.

b1539	EG12345	ydfG	NADP-dependent 3-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase; malonic semialdehyde reductase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	NADP-dependent 3-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase; malonic semialdehyde reductase	YdfG has NADP-dependent L-allo-threonine oxidase activity, and other in vitro oxidase activities including on L-serine, D-serine, D-threonine and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, although YdfG is presumed to be a reductase in vivo (Fujisawa, 2003). In vivo, YdfG can convert the toxic RutB product malonic semialdehyde into 3-hydroxypropionate and excrete it; and it is required for efficient growth using uridine as sole nitrogen source at 37C (in a rut operon constitutive ntrB background); YdfG is apparently supplementing the RutE presumed malonic semialdehyde reductase under these conditions since both are required to detoxify malonic semialdehyde and allow for efficient growth; both mutant growth defects are suppressed by NemA overproduction (Kim, 2010). The product of the oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl group of L-allo-threonine is aminoacetone, via spontaneous decarboxylation of the primary reaction product L-2-amino-3-ketobutyrate.

Vibrio alginolyticus NqrC (RsxG homolog) and NqrB (RsxD homolog) are covalently FMN flavinylated at residues Thr223 and Thr235, respectively (Hayashi, 2001).

b1633	EG10662	nth	DNA glycosylase and apyrimidinic (AP) lyase (endonuclease III)	Enzyme; Degradation of DNA	Endonuclease III: DNA N-glycosylase/AP lyase	E. coli Nth was originally discovered as an enzyme that cut UV-damaged DNA (Radman, 1976). E. coli Nth was re-discovered as a urea-DNA glycosylase (Breimer, 1980). Purified Nth has a DNA N-glycoslylase activity that creates apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) sites at certain DNA lesions that are then cleaved by AP lyase, a second Nth activity (Gates, 1977; Demple, 1980; Katcher, 1983; Breimer, 1984; Bailly, 1987; Kow, 1987; Kim, 1988). The AP lyase activity of Nth cleaves DNA by a beta elimination rather than a hydrolase mechanism, leading to the suggestion that Nth not be considered as an endonuclease; this notion was subsequently disputed by another group, and later reasserted (Bailly, 1987; Kim, 1988; Bailly, 1989). Nth contains a 4Fe-4S cluster that requires either IscA or SufA for proper assembly (Tan, 2009).

DtpA(TppB) was originally characterized in S. typhimurium. OmpR regulon. dtpA(tppB) is weakly stimulated by anaerobiosis in E. coli; Salmonella dtpA(tppB) is strongly stimulated by anaerobiosis. dtpA(tppB) in both species is not regulated by osmolarity. Salmonella dtpA(tppA) regulatory mutations were shown to be ompR mutations. Salmonella dtpA(tppB) mutants are resistant to the tripeptide antibiotic alafosfalin and cannot satisfy a leucine requirement with trileucine (Gibson, 1984). Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS).

b1639	EG11488	mliC	inhibitor of c-type lysozyme, membrane-bound; putative lipoprotein	Null	Inhibitor of c-type lysozyme, membrane-bound; predicted lipoprotein, lipobox conserved	E. coli K-12 has three vertebrate lysozyme inhibitors, the two c-type (chicken) inhibitors membrane-bound MliC and periplamsic Ivy, and one g-type (goose) inhibitor PliG (Vanderkelen. 2010). MliC is membrane-bound, consistent with the prediction that it is a lipoprotein (Callewaert, 2008). mliC is in the Rcs regulon (Callewaert, 2009). A mliC(ydhA) mutant has no obvious phenotype, and mliC(ydhA) mRNA was not detected (Lam, 1992). The first 17 aa of MliC are predicted to be a type II signal peptide. The solution structure of an 82 aa C-terminal fragment (with a 20 aa N-tag added) was determined, and a disulfide bond between C37 and C102 was observed (precursor numbering) (Revington, 2006). The unlikely, originally annotated, start site at M28 was misinterpreted as the start of a mature MliC(YdhA) protein (Revington, 2006). The predicted lipoprotein nature of MliC has not been experimentally confirmed. SignalP predicts a possible type I signal cleavage after residue 22, but the LipoP prediction for a lipoprotein is much better.

The slyA-ydhIJK divergent promoter region binds FNR and ydhIJK operon expression is activated by FNR (Federowicz, 2014).
b1644	EG13944	ydhJ	putative membrane fusion protein (MFP) of YdhJK efflux pump	Putative membrane; Not classified	Predicted membrane fusion protein (MFP) of YdhJK efflux pump; function unknown	YdhJ has a putative signal anchor. The slyA-ydhIJK divergent promoter region binds FNR and ydhIJK operon expression is activated by FNR (Federowicz, 2014). Overexpression of YdhJ causes abnormal biofilm architecture and reduced motility (Tenorio, 2003).

SodC is repressed anaerobically by FNR and is induced in stationary phase by RpoS (Gort, 1999). SodC has an Ig-like domain: pfam PF00080 aligns to residues 33-172.

b1649	EG13947	nemR	transcriptional repressor for the nemRA-gloA operon, quinone-, glyoxal-, and HOCl-activated	Null	nemRA-gloA operon repressor; quinone-, glyoxal-, and HOCl-activated	NemR is a redox-regulated transcriptional repressor that has HOCl-sensitive cysteine residues used to respond to bleach and other reactive chlorine species (Gray, 2013). nemR is part of the nemRA-gloA operon involved in electrophile detoxification; the NemR represssor is released from DNA upon sensing quinones and glyoxals (Lee, 2013). nemR mutants suppress the putative malonic semialdehyde reductase defects of rutE or ydfG mutants, presuambly by overproducing NemA (Kim, 2010). NemR is inactivated by NEM and other Cys modification reagents (Umezawa, 2008). TetR family.
b1650	EG13546	nemA	chromate reductase, quinone reductase, FMN-linked; N-Ethylmaleimide reductase; old yellow enzyme	Enzyme; Central intermediary metabolism: Pool, multipurpose conversions	Chromate reductase, quinone reductase, FMN-linked; N-Ethylmaleimide reductase; old yellow enzyme	NemA is a chromate reductase (Robins, 2013). nemA is part of the nemRA-gloA operon involved in electrophile detoxification; NemA can reduce quinones and other electrophiles (Lee, 2013). NemA is the "old yellow enzyme" (OYE) of E. coli (Williams, 2002). nemR mutants suppress the putative malonic semialdehyde reductase defects of rutE or ydfG mutants, presuambly by overproducing NemA (Kim, 2010). The original characterization of NemA called it a cis-enoyl-CoA reductase involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids such as linoleic acid (Mizugaki, 1979).

b1652	EG11547	rnt	RNase T; exoribonuclease T; structured DNA 3' exonuclease; RNA processing; DNA repair	Enzyme; Degradation of RNA	RNase T; exoribonuclease T; structured DNA DNase; RNA processing; DNA repair	As an RNase, Rnt is required for 5S and 23S rRNA maturation and Rnt can mature tRNA and cleave sRNAs along with other RNAses (Reuven, 1993; Li, 1995; Li, 1998; Li, 1999). Terminal C and CC bases block ssRNA and ssDNA cleavage in vitro (Zuo, 2002). In vitro Rnt is an exonuclease for ssDNA with a higher affinity for DNA than RNA and the degradation of ssDNA by Rnt is tenfold more efficient than RNA degradation (Viswanathan, 1998; Zuo, 1999; Hsiao, 2012). Overproduction of Rnt suppresses the UV sensitivity of recJ, xseAB and sbcB mutants (Viswanathan, 1999). Mutant rnt cells are sensivitive to a variety of DNA damaging agents, including UV irradiation which conflicts with an earlier report (Padmanabha, 1991; Hsiao, 2014). Rnt digests Y-structured, bubble, and bulge DNA and works with Nfi(Endonuclease V) in DNA repair; Rnt can digest dsDNA and go through C and CC bases when digesting bulge and bubble DNA (Hsiao, 2014). 4/16 Rnt peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).

b1654	EG12181	grxD	glutaredoxin-4	Null	Monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4 with CGFS motif; substrate for thioredoxin reductase; mutants are hypersensitive to iron depletion	grxD mutations are synthetic lethal with mutations in the isc operon, suggesting that Grx4 is involved in an alternative FeS cluster assembly pathway; a similar synthetic lethality pattern was observed for the bolA-like gene ibaG(yrbA), but not for bolA (Butland, 2005; Yeung, 2011). Homodimeric monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4 binds FeS and can efficiently transfer FeS clusters to Fdx in vitro (Yeung, 2011). BolA can form a heterodimer in vitro with FeS-bound monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4 but this complex is much less efficient than the FeS-bound Grx4 homodimer in FeS cluster transfer to Fdx (Yeung, 2011). Grx4 is a highly abundant protein with ppGpp-dependent induction during stationary phase or iron depletion (Fernandes, 2005). Not a substrate for glutathione reductase. Although a deletion for grxD is in the Keio collection, it was also reported that grxD is an essential gene that could not be inactivated (Gerdes, 2003; Fernandes, 2005; Baba, 2006). grxD, but not bolA or ibaG(yrbA) mutants are hypersensitive to iron depletion (Yeung, 2011).
b1655	EG13949	mepH	murein DD-endopeptidase, space-maker hydrolase	Enzyme; Murein sacculus, peptidoglycan	Murein DD-endopeptidase, space-maker hydrolase	The periplasmic protein MepH(YdhO) is one of three D-alanine-meso-DAP specific murein DD-endopeptidases, including MepS(Spr) and MepM(YebA), which are the long predicted space-maker hydrolases needed to cleave peptide cross-bridges in murein so that the murein sacculus can be elongated by murein synthases; MepH(YdhO) can act on intact murein sacculi and soluble cross-linked muropeptide dimers; cloned mepH(ydhO) complements a mepS(spr) deletion; an mepS(spr)-mepH(ydhO)-mepM(yebA) triple mutation is lethal (Singh, 2012). MepS(Spr), NlpC, YafL and MepH(YdhO) are paralogous members of the NlpC/P60 peptidase superfamily (Pfam entry: PF00877). The first 27 aa of MepH(YdhO) are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. The spr, yebA, and ydhO genes have been renamed as mepS, mepM, and mepH, respectively (M. Reddy, personal communication).

b1663	EG12400	mdtK	multidrug efflux system transporter	Putative transport; Not classified	Multidrug resistance efflux protein; overexpression resistance to norfloxacin, acriflavine, deoxycholate, trimethoprim	An mdtK(norM) plasmid confers resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and acriflavine, and the tetraphenylphosphonium ion; some increase in kanamycin and streptomycin resistance was also observed (Morita, 1998). An mdtK(ydhE) plasmid confers resistance to chloramphenicol, norfloxacin, enoxacin, fosfomycin, doxorubicin, trimethoprim, ethidium bromide, benzalkonium, tetraphenylphosphonium bromide, SDS, and deoxycholate (Nishino, 2001). An mdtK(ydhE) plasmid confers resistance to norfloxacin and ethidium bromide and these cells have reduced cellular concentrations of norfloxacin and ethidium bromide (Long, 2008). An mdtK(ydhE) plasmid confers resistance to ethidium bromide, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, rhodamine 6G, acriflavine, crystal violet, norfloxacin, doxorubicin, novobiocin, berberine, benzalkonium, and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (Long, 2008). YdhE binds to rhodamine 6G with a KD of 3 microM and also binds to ethidium bromide, proflavine, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin with KDs of 10 microM, 22 microM, 90 microM, and 98 microM, respectively (Long, 2008). An mdtK(norM) plasmid reduces the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species and presumably can export byproducts of bacterial metabolism that oxidize guanine (Guelfo, 2012). Over-expression of MdtK(NorE) confers resistance to growth inhibitory dipeptides, such as Ala-Gln, reducing their intracellular concentration (Hayashi, 2010). MATE family.

Pal restores the outer membrane integrity of an lpp mutant, but overproduced Lpp has no effect on a pal mutant phenotype. The first 20 aa of Lpp are a type II signal peptide.

MenI(YdiI) has the DHNA-CoA thioesterase activity required for the step after MenB in menaquinone biosynthesis; menI(ydiI) mutants have one third the normal level of menaquinone; MenH or other thioesterases may be responsible for the residual menaquinone, partially compensating for the loss of MenI(YdiI) (Chen, 2013). MenI(YdiI) exhibits Acyl-CoA esterase activity in vitro (Kuznetsova, 2005). MenI(YdiI) is a member of the HotDog superfamily of thioesterases and dehydratases (Pfam CL0050, PF03061; PDB 1VI8, 1VH5) (Dillon, 2004; Badger, 2005). menI(ydiI) clusters with other men genes and ubiE (gene neighborhood and co-occurrence) using the STRING server (string-db.org) (Franceschini, 2013).

YdiN is upregulated in shikimate-producer during carbon starvation (Johansson, 2006). ydiN is in an operon with shikimate genes ydiB and aroD. YdiN may be involved in the transport of shikimate or byproducts (quinic acid and 3-dehydroshikimic acid) of its overproduction: a second transport system for shikimate has not yet been mapped (Brown, 1976; Knop, 2001).

YdiV was named CdgR and characterized in Salmonella typhimurium wildtype strain ATCC 14028 as a protein required for the bacterium to resist host phagocyte oxidase in vivo; a Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 cdgR(ydiV) mutant is reported to have seven-fold higher c-di-GMP levels (Hisert, 2005). However, in contrast to previously published results, a Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 ydiV(cdgR,STM1344) mutant was found to have a lowered intracellular c-di-GMP and overexpression of ydiV(cdgR,STM1344) increased intracellular c-di-GMP, which may be attributable to differences in the c-di-GMP assay (soluble lysate vs total cell extraction); Salmonella typhimurium YdiV is a single domain EAL protein lacking phosphodiesterase, diguanylate cyclase, or c-di-GMP binding activity; YdiV(STM1344) is positive regulator of csgD transcription (Simm, 2009). In Salmonella typhimurium laboratory strain LT2 neither a ydiV mutation nor overexpression significantly affected c-di-GMP levels (Wada, 2011). Extracellular AI-1 stimulates ydiV RNA expression in an SdiA-dependent manner (Zhou, 2008). An sdiA ydiV double mutant has twofold reduced cAMP levels than inhibit quorum sensing system 2 (Zhou, 2008). ydiV RNA is 3.5-fold up-regulated by RpoS at ph 5 (Weber, 2006).

ChbG(YdjC) has promiscuous phosphonoesterase activity against a xenobiotic phosphorylated phosphonate (Kheronsky, 2011). chbG(ydjC) is a gene in the chb chitobiose catabolism operon. ChbG(YdjC) is a member of the InterPro IPR002509 polysaccharide deacetylase superfamily including yeast chitin deacetylase. The chb operon is induced by N,N'-diacetylchitobiose. The chb operon was previously thought to encode a cryptic cel operon for a cellobiose degradation system. The Cel+ phenotype is due to mutations making expression chitobiose-independent, but a fully induced operon did not support growth on cellobiose, implying a mutation altering the substrate specificity is needed; several candidate mutations were noted in Genbank, but not proven to alter the specificity of the system (Keyhani, 1997). In contrast, a later study claim that mutations making the operon expression high-level constitutive by chbR and nagC mutations are sufficient for the Cel+ phenotype and that no mutations altering substrate specificity are required (Kachroo, 2007).

The Cel+ phenotype is due to mutations making expression chitobiose-independent, but a fully induced operon did not support growth on cellobiose, implying a mutation altering the substrate specificity is needed; several candidate mutations were noted in Genbank, but not proven to alter the specificity of the system (Keyhani, 1997).

In contrast, a later study claim that mutations making the operon expression high-level constitutive by chbR and nagC mutations are sufficient for the Cel+ phenotype and that no mutations altering substrate specificity are required (Kachroo, 2007).

In contrast, a later study claim that mutations making the operon expression high-level constitutive by chbR and nagC mutations are sufficient for the Cel+ phenotype and that no mutations altering substrate specificity are required (Kachroo, 2007). The overexpressed, but native sequence, ChbA N-terminus was protein sequenced and the methionine is not removed, but the native RBS was not used in a pET vector so ChbA is not in the Verified Set (Keyhani, 2000).

In contrast, a later study claim that mutations making the operon expression high-level constitutive by chbR and nagC mutations are sufficient for the Cel+ phenotype and that no mutations altering substrate specificity are required (Kachroo, 2007). The chbBC intergenic region contains an RNA decoy (trap-mRNA) which is antisense to the chiX(micM) sRNA; induction of the chb operon leads to chiX(micM) degradation and consequently to chiP induction as chiX(micM) repression is relieved (Overgaard, 2009).

In a purified in vitro system, YnjE increases molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) biosynthesis independent of the YnjE active site cysteine and without enhancing IscS activity, indicating that YnjE is probably a specificity factor recruiting IscS to MoCo synthesis when competing IscS substrates are present, facilitated by YnjE binding to MoeB which then tightens the IscS-MoaD interaction (Dahl, 2011). A ynjE mutant does not have reduced MoCo synthesis when grown in LB in iscS+ strains, but a ynjE mutation does reduce the residual MoCo present in in iscS mutant; the IscS specificty function of YnjE may not be needed during growth in LB; in the absence of IscS YnjE may be able to compensate by direct transpersulfidation of MoaD in vivo (Dahl, 2011). The sulfurtransferase IscS transfers sulfur to the active site Cys of YnjE in vitro forming a persulfide (H?nzelmann, 2009). An iscS mutant has reduced YnjE sulfuration indicating that IscS can form a YnjE persulfide in vivo (Dahl, 2011). YnjE has weak in vitro thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity and does not have detectable 3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity (H?nzelmann, 2009). YnjE has three rhodanese domains. YnjE has an ambiguous signal prediction: the first 17 aa are predicted to be a type II signal peptide; the first 23 aa are predicted to be a type I signal peptide; YnjE is homologous to proteins with strong type II predictions; this may reflect signal type II to I evolution. YnjE has found to have a dual localization, being present in both the cytoplasm and the periplasm; no evidence for a membrane attachment was found (Dahl, 2011). The ambiguous signal peptide prediction for YnjE may indicate that the YnjE is poorly cleaved and secreted, leaving some protein in the cytoplasm and exporting some to the periplasm. The ynjE promoter region binds FNR and ynjE expression is activated by FNR (Federowicz, 2014).

Similar to eukaryotic GAPDH. Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). GapA binds selenium tightly even after denaturation, possibly as a perselenide to the active site Cys150, perhaps indicative of a role in selenium transport (Lacourciere, 2002). The C-terminal lysine K331 of GapA can be modified to either N6-malonyllysine or N6-succinyllysine; 10 additional GapA lysines can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011; Peng, 2011). GapA lysines K132, K138, K184, K198, and K249 can be modifed to N6-acetyllysine (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2009).

TsaBCDE are necessary and sufficient for tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification in vitro (Deutsch, 2012). TsaB(YeaZ) is required for the essential function of TsaD(YjgD) (El Yacoubi, 2011). TsaB(YeaZ) interacts with TsaE(YjeE) and TsaD(YgjD), preferring TsaD(YgjD); TsaB(YeaZ) can proteolyze TsaD(YgjD) in vitro (Handford, 2009). Depletion of TsaB(YeaZ) causes highly condensed nuceoids; the TsaB(YeaZ) depletion phenotype is suppressed by multicopy clones of rstA (Handford, 2009). The N-terminal domain of TsaB(YeaZ)is homologous to TsaD(YgjD). TsaB(YeaZ) does not have glycoprotease activity against glycophorin A (Handford, 2009). Salmonella TsaB(YeaZ) does not have glycoprotease activity and lacks a critical zinc binding motif (Nichols, 2009). Salmonella TsaB(YeaZ) has been identified as the first Gram-negative bacterial RPF (Resuscitation-Promoting Factor) capable of reviving VNC (viable but non-culturable) cells when added externally, but the million-fold lower activity as compared to Gram-positive bacterial RPFs may indicate a lack of physiological relevance (Panutdaporn, 2006).

RidA(YjgF), RutC, TdcF, YoaB and YjgH are paralogs and members of a highly conserved RidA(YjgF) family (pfam:PF01042) with diverse mutant phenotypes; the family members form homotrimers, some binding 2-ketoglutarate or related compounds, and all are probably reactive intermediate deaminases. The rat homolog PSP (perchloric acid-soluble protein) has been reported to have endoribonuclease activity, Endoribonuclease L, against ss mRNA, inhibiting translation.

b1827	EG14018	kdgR	KDG regulon transcriptional repressor	Regulator; Not classified	Transcriptional repressor for the KDG regulon	KdgR regulates 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) transport and catabolism (Pouyssegur, 1974). KDG is derived from pectin, a common plant heteropolysaccharide, although E. coli K-12 does not secrete pectinases or uptake pectin oligosaccharides and has only the core KDG regulon as compared to plant pathogens like Erwinia chrysanthemi, whose extracellular pectate lyases and intacellular oligogalacturonate lyase breaks pectin down mainly into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) monomers and to a lesser extent polygalacturonase-generated galacturonate; in E. coli K-12 galacturonate uptake and degradation is mediated by the ExuT permease and the UxaABC catabolic enzymes producing KDG, respectively, and DKI is imported by the KdgR-regulated KDG importer KdgT and catabolized to KDG by the KdgR-regulated KduID enyzymes, also producing KDG; KDG is converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by KdsK and Eda(KdsA) (Rodionov, 2004; Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, 1996). A kdgR-yebQ clone conferred hypersensitivity to trimethoprim, but a yebQ-alone expression clone did not, leading the authors to conclude that overexpression of the transcriptional regulator KdgR was responsible for the Acr-S phenoptype. 2/360 KdgR peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).

YebF Cys35 has been shown to be fully oxidized in vivo, probably because it forms a disulphide bond with Cys108 (Leichert, 2008). YebF Cys35 is fully oxidized in vivo and Cys108 is 85% oxidized in vivo; Cys35-Cys108 of YebF form a DsbA-dependent disulphide bond (Vertommen, 2008). It is not known if YebF confers colicin immunity. YebF is secreted into the periplasm then exported into the medium across the OM in a porin-dependent manner; OmpF, OmpC, and OmpX are involved in YebF export; YebF interacts with OmpF and OmpC at their periplasmic face; the YebF NMR structure is similar to Cmi and is stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys35 and Cys108 (Prehna, 2012). C-terminal fusions with YebG are exported, which is useful for exporting fusion proteins (Zhang, 2006; Fisher, 2011; Chen, 2012). The lipoprotein prediction is a proven false positive; the Cys is not conserved. First 21 aa are a cleaved signal peptide.

MepM(YebA) is needed for normal septation; mepM(yebA) mutants are more resistant to ampicillin, have septal defects and alleviate the growth defects associated with amiC, ampD and other murein hydrolases (Babu, 2011). NlpD, YgeR, MepM(YebA) and EnvC are members of the M23 clan of predicted metallopeptidases that have C-terminal LytM domains; mutating all four LytM domain genes produces a strain with a severe filamentous phenotype, similar to an amiABC triple mutant, of over 20 times the normal cell length and more than 70 times the normal amount of septa/cell, from 0.5 to 36 septa/cell; also similar to the amiABC mutant, the nlpD-envC-mepM(yebA)-ygeR mutant has altered morphology and delayed onset of lysis after beta-lactam antibiotic treatment (Uehara, 2009). MepM(YebA) must be in the periplasm as that is where its substrate is, but SignalP does not indicate a signal peptide cleavage site; nonetheless there is a single predicted transmembrane segment at positions 21-40 that likely serves as a signal anchor after membrane translocation. The spr, yebA, and ydhO genes have been renamed as mepS, mepM, and mepH, respectively (M. Reddy, personal communication).

b1870	EG14033	cmoA	carboxy-SAM synthase	Enzyme; tRNA modification	Carboxy-SAM synthase	The carboxy-SAM synthase CmoA utilizes prephenate as a carboxyl donor to synthesize carboxy-SAM, converting prephenate to phenylpyruvate and carbon dioxide; the departing prephenate hydroxyl group abstracts a proton from the S-methyl group of SAM generating water and a stabilized carbanion SAM ylide intermediate, which is then carboxylated by the carbon dioxide; prephenate is derived from chorismate; the carboxy-SAM co-factor is utilized by the CmoB tRNA (cmo5U34)-carboxymethyltransferase as the carboxymethyl donor (Kim, 2013). tRNAs from aroC and aroD mutants lack cmo5U and its methyl ester mcmo5U, implicating chorismate or a derivative in their synthesis (Bj?rk, 1979; Bj?rk, 1980; Hagervall, 1990). Two alternatives were proposed for the synthesis of cmo5U from ho5U in E. coli including the direct conversion by a carboxymethyltransferase (referred to as an acetylase) and a two-step reaction with mo5U as an intermediate; mo5U34 is present in the U wobble base of tRNAs from B. subtilis (Murao, 1978). CmoA, a member of the methyltrasferase superfamily, was previously thought to be involved in the chorismate-dependent conversion of mo5U34 to cmo5U34 in tRNA as both ho5U and mo5U accumulated in a cmoA mutant and in an aroD mutant, although a mechanism was not apparent; CmoB was previously thought to be responsible for the conversion of ho5U to mo5U since only ho5U accumulated in a cmoB mutants (Nasvall, 2004). Now it seems, since mo5U is not an intermediate in (m)cmo5U synthesis, that CmoB might utilize SAM inefficiently in the absence of CmoA-generated carboxy-SAM to form mo5U. Carboxy-SAM (Cx-SAM), also called S-adenosyl-S-carboxymethyl-l-homocysteine (SCM-SAH), was identified in crystal structures of E. coli and H. influenzae CmoA (Kim, 2013; Byrne, 2013). otherPDB (H. influenzae): 1IM8 (Lim, 2001). 4/128 CmoA(YecO) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). CmoA peptide masses from MS/MS analysis indicate this is the correct start site and that the initial Met is removed (Guo, 2014).
b1871	EG14034	cmoB	tRNA (cmo5U34)-carboxymethyltransferase, carboxy-SAM-dependent	Enzyme; tRNA modification	tRNA (cmo5U34)-carboxymethyltransferase, carboxy-SAM-dependent	The carboxymethyltransferase CmoB utilizes the novel SAM derivative carboxy-SAM to convert 5-hydroxyuridine (ho5U34) to 5-oxyacetyl uridine (cmo5U34) in tRNA; the enzymes responsible for making ho5U and mcmoU5 are unknown (Kim, 2013). Two alternatives were proposed for the synthesis of cmo5U from ho5U in E. coli including the direct conversion by an acetylase (actually a carboxymethyltransferase) and a two-step reaction with mo5U as an intermediate; mo5U34 is present in the U wobble base of tRNAs from B. subtilis (Murao, 1978). In S. typhimurium, CmoA, a member of the methyltransferase superfamily, was previously thought to be involved in the chorismate-dependent conversion of mo5U34 to cmo5U34 in tRNA as both ho5U and mo5U accumulated in a cmoA mutant and in an aroD mutant, although a mechanism was not apparent; CmoB was previously thought to be responsible for the conversion of ho5U to mo5U since only ho5U accumulated in a cmoB mutants (Nasvall, 2004). Now it seems from work done in E. coli, that since mo5U is not an intermediate in (m)cmo5U synthesis, CmoB might utilize SAM inefficiently in the absence of CmoA-generated carboxy-SAM to form mo5U from ho5U. It is also possible that mcmo5U is made from cmo5U by CmoB utilizing SAM instead of carboxy-SAM.

A mutation resulting in a tyrosine to tryptophan substitution at position 106 results in a hyperactive phenotype, while a double mutation T87I/Y106W resulted in loss of activity. Substitutions at ILE95 affect FliM binding. CheY can be reversibly acetylated at lysine residues 91, 92, 109, 119, 122, and 126 by acetyl-CoA synthase (Acs) in vitro (Barak, 1992; Barak, 2004). CheY can autoacetylate lysines in its C-terminal region in vitro (Barak, 2006). A high level of lysine acetylation of CheY is detected in vivo, and both Acs-dependent, acetate-stimulated acetylation and Acs-independent acetylation occurs (Yan, 2008). In vivo Acs-dependent lysine acetylation of CheY is consistent with the chemotaxis defects observed in Acs mutants and CheY Lys92 mutants (Barak, 2001) Acs-independent acetylation of CheY could be due to autoacetylation or the activity of a second lysine acetyltransferase such as the lysine acetyltransferase Pka(YfiQ) that has been shown to acetylate Acs lysines in vivo in Salmonella. CobB can deacetylate CheY in vitro and in vivo, reducing FliM binding and chemotaxis (Li, 2010). cobB is a mutational phenotypic suppressor of a cheA cheZ double mutation (Li, 2010).

E. coli makes an unknown weak auto-inducer when grown in rich media. Most phenotypic effects require overproduction of SdiA. sdiA mutants are more sensitive to fluoroquinolones and have reduced AcrB protein, but are not defective in cell division.

FliZ antagonizes Crl activation of a subset of RpoS-dependent promoters, without changing RpoS levels, and thus resembles an anti-sigma factor at Crl-stimulated RpoS promoters (Pesavento, 2008). FliZ may also regulate FliA (sigma 28). The motility defect of yhjH mutations is suppressed by multicopy yfgF and by mutations in ycgR, fliZ, yfiR, yegE, crfC(yjdA), and yjcZ (Girgis, 2007).

Glyoxalase III (HchA) is a stationary phase enzyme regulated by RpoS (Benov, 2004). Hsp31(HchA) chaperone activity is inhibited at high temperature by ATP. HchA is involved in the processing of 8-12mer peptides in vivo. HchA is a weak active site cysteine peptidase.

b1970	EG14046	hiuH	hydroxyisourate hydrolase	Enzyme; Purine catabolism	Hydroxyisourate hydrolase; HIU hydrolase, HIUHase; periplasmic transthyretin-like protein (TLP); EcTRP; tetrameric, metal-binding; unrelated to soybean HIUHase	Purified E. coli HiuH(YedX) hydrolyzes 5-hydroxyisourate producing both allantoin and the intermediate 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) which will spontaneously decay into a racemic mixture of R- and S-allantoin but AllB allantoinase metabolizes S-allantoin only, so HiuH may also have OHCU decarboxylase activity (Lee, 2005; Hennebry, 2006). The E. coli K-12 genome does not encode an OHCU decarboxylase (COG3195) homolog. E. coli can convert xanthine to allantoin, although less efficiently than K. pneumoniae; HiuH(YedX) might participate in purine catabolism by helping to degrade the uric acid produced by xanthine dehydrogenase (Xi, 2000). It has been suggested that the lack of uricase enzyme activity might be partially compensated for by a spontaneous reaction of uric acid acting as an antioxidant in the periplasm resulting in a non-enzymatic production of 5-hydroxyisourate and that HiuH might protect from free radicals (Hennebry, 2006). The HIUHase family has a C -terminal YRGS conserved motif. Purified E. coli HiuH(YedX) can be induced to form fibrils with stirring or heat (Santos, 2008; Lundberg, 2009). Cleavage of the 23 aa signal peptide and the periplasmic localization of HiuH(YedX) have been experimentally verified (Mitchell, R., Hus, N. and Rudd, K.E., unpublished results, 1999).

b1973	EG14049	zinT	zinc and cadmium binding protein, periplasmic 	Null	Periplasmic zinc and cadmium binding protein; induced by zinc, cadmium or peroxide; Zur, SoxS and Fur regulated	A zinT mutant grows slightly slower than wt, and has three-fold lower Zn(2+) levels, in Zn(2+)-depleted media; ZinT binds Zn(2+) preferentially over Cd(2+) and zinT expression is induced by Zn(2+) depletion (Graham, 2009). An earlier report that zinT mutants require added zinc for growth is in conflict with more recent results (Kershaw, 2007; Graham, 2009). ZinT is proposed to be either a periplasmic zinc chaperone or a zinc-binding protein involved in zinc import (Kershaw, 2007; Graham, 2009). Overexpression causes abnormal biofilm architecture. ZinT(YodA) is lipocalin-like.

Wzc is autophosphorylated intra-molecularly at Y569 and inter-molecularly at Y708, Y710, Y711, Y713 and Y715, as experimentally demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro kinase assays; the Wzc Walker A ATP-binding site motif is required for intra-phosphorylation at Y569: Y569-P is required for inter-phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residues (Grangeasse, 2002). Wzc-P is also dephosphorylated in vitro by the cryptic Etp phosphatase (Vincent, 2000). Wzc has ATPAse activity (Soulat, 2007).

SignalP and TMHMM indicate a single N-terminal transmembrane segment of AsmA may serve as a signal anchor. Thus AsmA is predicted to be mostly periplasmic, consistent with its role in outer membrane assembly of OmpF. Although no association of AsmA with the OM was detected, AsmA superfamily members YhjG and YicH (but not AsmA itself) were predicted to be beta-barrel proteins indicating that the inner membrane-anchored AsmA family proteins may also insert into the outer membrane, consistent with their putative role in OM protein assembly and OM maintenance (Zhai, 2009).

The motility defect of yhjH mutations is suppressed by multicopy yfgF and by mutations in ycgR, fliZ, yfiR, yegE, crfC(yjdA) and yjcZ (Girgis, 2007).

b2077	EG12136	iceT	putative citrate/iron-citrate/zinc-citrate efflux transporter	Putative transport; Not classified	Putative citrate/iron-citrate/zinc-citrate efflux transporter; putative arabinose exporter	Salmonella IceT(MdtD) has been characterized as a citrate and iron-citrate efflux transporter (Frawley, 2013). iceT(mdtD) mutants grow slower in the presence of zinc at high cell density and have a dramatically increased intracellular free zinc concentration after zinc shock, indicating that IceT may export zinc-citrate; the authors note that "it is likely that zinc is co-transported in a complex with other ligands that are substrates of MdtD" (Wang, 2013). Plasmid-mediated mdtABC-iceT(mdtD) overexpression confers resistance to deoxycholate and novobiocin in an acrAB mutant background but the same resistances are observed with mdtABC overexpression, indicating that iceT(mdtD) does not confer multidrug resistance (Nishino, 2001; Nagakubo, 2002). Chromosomal mdtABC-iceT(mdtD) expression induced by plasmid-mediated BaeR overproduction increases resistance to deoxycholate and novobiocin in an acrAB mutant; mutations in mdtB and mdtC but not iceT(mdtD) abolish this BaeR-induced resistance phenotype (Baranova, 2002). Consistent with arabinose export, an iceT(mdtD) mutant has increased intracellular arabinose, but not xylose; other compounds were not tested (Koita, 2012).

The YpdAB and YehTU two-component regulators are paralogous; these two systems may be interconnected since they both regulate yjiY, directly by YehTU and indirectly by YpdAB; although not noted by the authors, both sytems also regulate yhjX, indirectly by YehTU and directly by YpdAB; the putative transporter genes yhjX and yjiY are the only two genes significantly regulated by YpdAB and YehTU (Fried, 2013).

It requires LB+ thymidine and grows poorly, explaining the Baba negative result. Thus, folE is not an essential gene. FolE is the first enzyme of pre-Q(0) biosynthesis (Phillips, 2008). The yeiG-folEyeiB divergent operon promoter region binds ArcA and folE-yeiB expression is repressed by ArcA (Federowicz. 2014).

CirA mediates TonB-dependent translocation of Colicin IA into cells (Jakes, 2010). CirA is a member of the Outer Membrane Receptor (OMR) family of ligand-gated protein channels that utilizes the proton motive force (PMF) and the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex for iron-siderophore, colicin and microcin uptake. The OMR family belongs to the Porin superfamily and deletions in OMR family proteins can restore a passive diffusion channel function typical of normal OM porins.

The first 26 aa of MepS(Spr) are a type II signal peptide. MepS(Spr), NlpC, YafL and MepH(YdhO) are paralogous members of the NlpC/P60 peptidase superfamily (Pfam entry: PF00877).

A small putative protein gene yojO was predicted upstream of napF (Hemm, 2008). The annotation of yojO has been removed as it is unlikely to be a protein-coding gene; the apparent conservation in this region seems to be due to DNA conservation of the napF transcription factor binding sites.

b2214	EG12073	apbE	putative thiamine-synthetic flavin transferase lipoprotein	Null	Putative flavin transferase, lipoprotein	ApbE is probably required for a covalent flavination of conserved residues Thr187 in RsxD and Thr174 in RsxG with FMN, which then are likely to be required for the reduction of the 4Fe-4S cluster in ThiC in addition to the known Rsx function to reduce the 2Fe-2S cluster in SoxR. ApbE of Vibrio harveyi is a flavin transferase required for the covalent flavinylation of NqrC, an RsxG homolog, with FMN at position Thr229 (Bertsova, 2013). Vibrio cholerae RnfD (RsxD homolog) and RnfG (RsxG homolog) are covalently FMN flavinylated at residues Thr187 and Thr175, respectively (Backiel, 2008). Vibrio alginolyticus NqrC (RsxG homolog) and NqrB (RsxD homolog) are covalently FMN flavinylated at residues Thr223 and Thr235, respectively (Hayashi, 2001). ApbE of Salmonella typhimurium is required for the assembly or repair of 4Fe-4S clusters (Skovran, 2003). An apbE mutant of Salmonella typhimurium is blocked for thiamine biosynthesis at the ThiC step (conversion of AIR to HMP) and Salmonella ApbE is anchored to the inner membrane in a periplasmic location; the periplasmic location, but not the membrane anchor, is required for ApbE function (Beck, 1998; Beck, 1999). Purified E. coli ApbE is dimeric and, unlike the ApbE superfamily member TP0796 from Treponema pallidum, E. coli ApbE does not possess FAD pyrophosphatase activity in vitro (Deca, 2013). The structure of the S. enterica ApbE has a bound FAD molecule (Boyd, 2011). The first 19 aa of ApbE constitute a type II signal peptide.

HT_Cmplx42_Mem: RcsB+YfgM (Lasserre, 2006). YfgM may be an anti-RcsB factor (Westphal, 2012). 2/22 RcsB peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). When RcsB is overexpressed, it reverses the ftsZ84 growth defect on low-salt medium. RcsB is required for the inducible acid resistance response (Johnson, 2011).

E. coli pmrD is induced by low Mg(2+) in a PhoP-dependent manner, thus the E. coli prmD product itself is non-functional, as shown by the fact that replacing the E. coli chromosomal prmD with the Salmonella prmD confers the Salmonella low Mg(2+) response to E. coli (Winfield, 2004). Although PmrA represses pmrD transcription in Salmonella, pmrD is not regulated by pmrA in E. coli (Winfield, 2004). A Salmonella prmD mutation eliminates the polymyxin B resistance induced in low Mg(2+), and this defect is corrected by a complementing Salmonella prmD+ clone (Kox, 2000); prmD+ E. coli K-12 does not show low Mg(+2)-induced polymyxin B resistance at all (Kato, 2007). However, citing their unpublished results, Kox (2000) report that E. coli K-12 prmD can fully rescue the Salmonella prmD defect, and they conclude that prmD is functional. Although this experimental result is not refuted, repeated or discussed in Kato (2007), it seems as if this unpublished observation has been retracted. PhoPQ regulon.

EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) are required to modify EF-P Lys34 by lysylation of the epsilon amino group; failure to modify EF-P with lysine results in a slow growth defect; EpmB(YjeK) may convert alpha-lysyl-EF-P to beta-lysyl-EF-P (Yanagisawa, 2010). A third and final EF-P post-translation modification enzyme EpmC(YfcM) is identified as EF-P-Lys34 hydroxylase; EpmC(YfcM) acts after beta-lysinylation of Lys34 by EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK); EpmC(YfcM) adds an oxygen atom to the C5 position of Lys34 and does not modify the added beta-lysine; YjeA and YjeK were renamed as EpmA and EpmB, respectively (Peil, 2012).

The etoposide-induced protein 2.4 family (EI24, PF0726), formerly known as DUF540, is named after the eukaryotic EI24 protein induced by the cytotoxic drug etoposide; ei24 is a p53 response gene involved in growth suppression and apoptosis (Gu, 2000).

MurNAc is not a preferred carbon source as is supports a growth rate that is four times sslower than when using preferred carbon sources. Probable false positive lipoprotein prediction, Cys not conserved, 9 CM TMs predicted. The divergent murR and murQP transcripts have complementary 5' ends (Jaeger, 2008).
b2430	EG14164	yfeW	penicillin binding protein PBP4B; weak DD-carboxypeptidase activity	Enzyme; Murein sacculus, peptidoglycan	Penicillin binding protein PBP4B; weak DD-carboxypeptidase activity	A mutation in yfeW(pbp4B) does not affect growth on MurNAc (Jaeger, 2008). yfeW(pbp4B) is probably transcribed as part of the murQP-yfeW operon and from a promoter within murP (Jaeger, 2008). YfeW(Pbp4B) was originally annotated as a 463 aa protein but has been corrected to use a more likely and well-conserved start codon and YfeW is currently annotated as a 434 aa protein; the first 19 aa of the revised protein sequence are predicted to be a signal peptide. YfeW(Pbp4B) was overexpressed and assayed using the 463 aa version with the unlikely 29 aa N-terminal extension; this is why the authors did not detect the predicted signal peptide and possibly why the recombinant Pbp4B was isolated in membrane fractions when it is likely to be a periplasmic protein (Vega, 2006). UPF0214 family, related to ampC. Probable false positive lipoprotein prediction, Cys not conserved. Non-essential.
b2431	EG14165	yfeX	porphyrinogen oxidase, cytoplasmic	Enzyme; Transport of small molecules: Cations	Porphyrinogen oxidase, cytoplasmic; binds heme and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX)	The previously reported deferrochelatase activity of YfeX could not be reproduced; in addition to various dye-decolorization reactions, YfeX can oxidize protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin in vitro (Dailey, 2011). The acquisition of iron from exogenous heme when the foreign heme receptor HasR is expressed is reduced in an efeB or yfeX single mutant and eliminated in an efeB yfeX double mutant; overproduced EfeB complements a yfeX mutation, indicating some cytoplasmic activity of EfeB; the Dpp dipeptide/heme permease is required since the utilization of iron extracted from heme by EfeB in the periplasm requires an active EfeUOB iron transporter; it is reported that iron is extracted without rupturing the tetrapyyrol ring, but this is later contradicted; EfeB and YfeX facilitate the conversion of heme to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) (Letoffe, 2009). YfeX binds heme and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in vitro and in vivo ((Letoffe, 2009). yfeX and efeB are paralogs in the DyP-type peroxidase family. Pfam 04261. COG2837.

AmiA is a verified Tat substrate (Bernhardt, 2003). AmiA has a predicted Tat-only (Class I) 34 aa signal peptide (Tullman-Ercek, 2007). In amiABC triple mutants, thickened dark bands termed septal peptidoglycan (SP) rings appear at division sites, representing a cell division structure that accumulates when septal synthesis and hydrolysis by the AmiABC amidases are uncoupled (Priyadarshini, 2007). A mutant lacking five murein hydrolases (amiABCmltCD=MHD90) has a delayed lysis phenotype after beta-lactam treatment (Heidrich, 2002).

LoiP(YggG) interacts with the periplasmic metalloprotease/chaperone BepA(YfgC) required for the OM attachment of LoiP(YggG) (L��tticke, 2012). BepA(YfgC) is a TPR-repeats-containing protein of the M48 protease family; BepA(YfgC) has four tandem TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) domains at residues 309 to 460. A bepA(yfgC) mutant has increased sensitivity to several antibiotics (Girgis, 2009). Overexpression of BepA(YfgC)causes abnormal biofilm architecture.

YfgF does not have diguanylate cyclase activity and is an active cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (Lacey, 2010). YfgF has an N-terminal MASE1 transmembrane signaling domain, a defective diguanylate cyclase domain, then a C-terminal cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase domain; the PDE domain has EIL instead of EAL. YfgF is expressed during anaerobic growth maximally in stationary phase at low temperatures and yfgF is regulated by FNR (Lacey, 2010). yfgF mutations increase biofilm formation and peroxide sensitivity (Lacey, 2010).

YihI stimulates Der GTPase, possibly acting as a negative regulator of 50S ribosome assembly and retarding early exponential growth (Hwang, 2010). Der has two tandem GTP-binding domains. der is an essential gene. Der and YihI form a complex, as does Der-delta200 (lacking the N-terminal 200 aa domain of Der) and YihI-delta45 (lacking the N-terminal 45 amino acids of YihI) (Kobayashi, 2009; Hwang, 2010). Der and YihA are paralogs, with YihA matching the C-terminal GTPase domain better than the N-terminal GTPase domain. The YhiI stimulation of Der GTPase activity requires both Der Ser16 and Ser216, indicating both Der GTP-binding domain activities are required for Der GTPase activity (Hwang, 2010).

BamB binds PQQ and is involved in the PQQ-mediated radiation stress response, bamB mutants are UV-sensitive, and BamB has PQQ-stimulated autophosphorylating Ser/Thr protein kinase activity (Khairnar, 2007). RpoE regulon. Deletion of bamB in strain LF82 resulted in a decreased ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells and a decreased release of outer membrane vesicles. A mutant of bamB in Salmonella enteritidis has lowered chick cell invasion, flagellar protein secretion, and motility. The first 19 aa of BamB are a type II signal peptide.

YfgM overproduction decreases acid resistance like an rcsB mutation does, YfgM is degraded by FtsH, and YfgM may be an anti-RcsB factor (Westphal, 2012). HT_Cmplx42_Mem: RcsB+YfgM (Lasserre, 2006). A native membrane complex of YfgM and PpiD has been detected (Maddalo, 2011). YfgM may be ribosome associated (Jiang, 2007). 7/55 YfgM peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). UPF0070 family.

Radical SAM superfamily. RlmN is homologous to the cfr chloramphenicol resistance gene on plasmid pSCFS1 from Staphylococcus sciuri (Schwarz, 2000). YfgB is RlmN; rlmN- is twofold more sensitive to tiamulin, hygromycin A, and sparsomycin; although growth is not obviously impaired, wildtype outcompetes rlmN- (Toh, 2008).

b2520	EG13394	yfhM	bacterial alpha2-macroglobulin colonization factor ECAM; anti-host protease defense factor; periplasmic inner membrane-anchored lipoprotein	Null	Bacterial alpha2-macroglobulin colonization factor ECAM; anti-host proteinase defense factor; periplasmic inner membrane-anchored lipoprotein	Bacterial alpha2-macroglobulins, including YfhM, appear to have been acquired by Gram-negative bacteria from their metazoan hosts; repair transpeptidase PbpC and YfhM are encoded in a di-cistronic operon and may function together as a periplasmic defense and repair system (Budd, 2004). YfhM has been detected as a membrane-bound homotrimer although an earlier report found N-terminal modifed soluble YfhM to be monomeric (Doan, 2008; Maddalo, 2011). In vitro, E. coli K-12 MG1655 YfhM binds, covalently links, and inhibits by sequestering equine neutrophil elastase (HNE), a serine proteinase probably encountered during saprophytically colonization of mammalian hosts by non-pathogenic E. coli strains; the YfhM-HNE complex splits into 103 kDa (YfhM'-HNE) and 79 kDa (YfhM') fragments (Doan, 2008). Analagous to human alpha2-macroglobulin, YfhM(ECAM) has an intact stable beta-cysteinyl-gamma-glutamyl thiol ester at CxEQ within the conserved bacterial motif PYGCxEQtxS (residues 1184-1193) involved in covalent inactivation of attacking proteases (Budd, 2004; Doan, 2008). The first 17 aa of YfhM are predicted to be a type II signal peptide.

Monomeric IscX forms octamers in the presence of iron; IscX binds IscS and both ferric and ferrous iron (Pastore, 2006). 
b2525	EG11328	fdx	[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin	Carrier; Energy metabolism, carbon: Electron transport	Ferredoxin, an iron-sulfur protein; involved in assembly of other Fe-S clusters	The fdx gene is cotranscribed with hscBA and is cold inducible.

b2528	EG12132	iscA	FeS cluster assembly protein	Putative regulator; Not classified	Recruit and deliver Fe for Fe-S cluster assembly in IscU; possibly an alternative scaffold for Fe-S cluster assembly	Either IscA or SufA are required for the proper assembly of 4Fe-4S clusters but not 2Fe-2S clusters (Tan, 2009). iscA, sufA, and erpA are paralogs; nfuA is a possible HT gene with an N-terminal domain homologous to sufA and an additional thioredoxin-like C-terminal domain.
b2529	EG13395	iscU	iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein	Null	Iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein	IscU fails to assemble Fe-S clusters in the presence of sodium citrate due to restricted free iron availability, however Fe-S cluster formation is restored, with sodium citrate present, in the presence of IscA. IscU and IscS form a complex (Agar, 2000; Tokumoto, 2002; Kato, 2002; Prischi, 2010). The IscU-IscS complex is stabilized by a covalent disifide bond between Cys328 of IscS and Cys63 of IscU (Kato, 2002). IscU has been classified as a "complex-orphan" protein that is largely unstructured unless bound to a partner, i.e. IscS (Prischi, 2010).
b2530	EG12677	iscS	cysteine desulfurase (tRNA sulfurtransferase), PLP-dependent	Enzyme; tRNA modification	Cysteine desulfurase, PLP-dependent; used in synthesis of Fe-S clusters and 4-thiouridine; ThiI transpersulfidase; TusA transpersulfidase; YnjE transpersulfidase; MoaD transpersulfidase; pyridoxal phosphate cofactor linked to Lys206	IscS desulfurase from cysteine via a Cys328 persulfide to binding partners as a transpersulfidase with ThiI Cys456 for tRNA s(4)U8 modification and with TusA Cys19 to thiolate tRNA U34. IscS has selenocysteine lyase activity in vitro. Two components Factor A (NuvA, 9.3) and Factor B (NuvB, ~45') were originally shown to be required for tRNA s(4)U8 modification with NuvC being the pyridoxal phosphate requiring factor; despite the mapping discrepancy it seems likely that IscS (57.3') is Factor C (NuvC) and ThiI (9.3') is Factor A (NuvA) (Kambampati, 2000). IscU and IscS form a complex (Agar, 2000; Tokumoto, 2002; Kato, 2002; Prischi, 2010). The IscU-IscS complex is stabilized by a covalent disifide bond between Cys328 of IscS and Cys63 of IscU (Kato, 2002). YnjE, IscS, MoaD and MoeB form a complex in vivo (Dahl, 2011). IscU has been classified as a "complex-orphan" protein that is largely unstructured unless bound to a partner, i.e. IscS (Prischi, 2010). 2/409 peptide masses from MS analysis indicate that a start codon eight codons upstream is utilized, but this conflicts with protein sequencing results (Maillet, 2007). PDB structures 3LVJ, 3LVK, 3LVL and 3LVM are derived from E. coli O157:H7 but are identical to the K-12 IscS sequence.

In nitrogen limitation GlnB is subject to post-translational modification by uridylylation (mediated by GlnD) of Tyr51 in the T-loop of each subunit. This modification is reversed in N-sufficient conditions. GlnB interacts with and regulates the activities of the histidine protein kinase NtrB, which controls phosphorylation of NtrC. It also regulates the activity of adenylyltransferase (GlnE) which in turn regulates the activity of glutamine synthetase (GlnA). glnK is a glnB paralog.

Also characterized in an EPEC strain, QseC activates transcription of qseEGF(glrK-yfhG-glrR) in response to the autoinducer-3 (AI-3)/epinephrine/norepinephrine interkingdom signaling system (Reading, 2007). GlrK(QseE,YfhK) phosphorylates GlrR(QseF,YfhA) and has autokinase activity in vitro; GlrR(QseF,YfhA) is also phosphorylated in vitro by non-cognate sensors UhpB, BaeS, EnvZ and RstB (Yamamoto, 2005). QseEF(GlrKR) responds directly to epinephrine, sulfate and phosphate (Reading, 2009).
b2555	EG12139	yfhG	putative outer membrane protein modulating the QseEF response	Phenotype; Not classified	Predicted OM protein possibly affecting the QseEF response	YfhG has been functionally characterized as an OM protein affecting the QseEF(GlrKR) response in the E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 strain and renamed as QseG; EPEC QseG is transcriptionally activated by AI-3, epinephrine, and norepinephrine via QseC; EPEC QseG has been characterized as an autorepressor but does not contain known DNA-binding motifs (Reading, 2009). The first 25 aa of YfhG are predicted to be a signal peptide. Verified Tat substrate: YfhG(QseG) has a Tat/Sec (Class II) predicted 25 aa signal peptide (Tullman-Ercek, 2007). Although the YfhG(QseG) signal peptide has been shown to be capable of mediating Tat-dependent and Tat-independent translocation in a fusion reporter system (Tullman-Ercek, 2007), the twin arginines are not conserved. The predicted type II (lipoprotein) cleavage site may be a false positive prediction, although the protein family name for PF13942 is named as Lipoprotein_20 based on the lipoprotein prediction. The mature protein has an N-terminal Cys residue.

Also characterized in an EPEC strain, QseC activates transcription of qseEGF(glrK-yfhG-glrR) in response to the autoinducer-3 (AI-3)/epinephrine/norepinephrine interkingdom signaling system (Reading, 2007). The sensor kinase QseE(GlrK) is responsive to epinephrine, sulfate and phosphate and transcription is activated by AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine via QseC in EPEC (Reading, 2007). GlrK(QseE,YfhK) phosphorylates GlrR(QseF,YfhA) and has autokinase activity in vitro (Yamamoto, 2005). QseEF also responds directly to epinephrine, sulfate and phosphate in EPEC (Reading, 2009).

b2558	EG11373	mltF	membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase F, murein hydrolase	Enzyme; Transporter; Not classified	Membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase F, murein hydrolase	MltF is an exolytic transglycosylase that can degrade non-crosslinked murein chains, and MltF is the least active of all seven lytic transglycosylases (Lee, 2013). The N-terminus (22-273) is homologous to ABC-type periplasmic binding proteins; the C-terminus (294-387) encodes the MltF function. Rob regulon. The first 21 aa of MltF are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. MltF is a lytic transglycosylase and apparently can compensate for the loss of the other six other lytic transglycosylases because mltF cannot be knocked out in strain MHD79 which lacks slt and mltA-E (Scheurwater, 2008). The function of the N-terminal domain is unknown, but it appears to modulate the MltF activity to be like hen lysozyme in that murein hydrolysis has linear time dependence, unlike the other MltA-E, which display an initial burst of activity then slow down (Scheurwater, 2008). MltF is attached to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane (Scheurwater, 2008).

RseC has an RpoE-independent role in thiamine synthesis in Salmonella typhimurium (Beck, 1997). RseC is an inner membrane protein with two transmembrane helices and a C-terminus in the cytoplasm (Daley, 2005). RseC gives a probable false positive lipoprotein prediction since the lipobox is not conserved (Gonnet, 2004).

The periplasmic domain of RseA is first degraded by DegS; subsequent cytoplasmic domain degradation of RseA of requires RseP(YaeL). The RseA Tyr46 is phoshorylated and is de-phosphorylated by Etp. rseA is transiently induced after a cold shock, dependent on the presence of PNPase. rseA mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006).

b2584	EG14224	pka	protein lysine acetyltransferase	Enzyme; Proteins - translation and modification	Protein lysine acetyltransferase	In E. coli K-12 the patA gene name mnemonic has already been used for putrescine aminotransferase, precluding its use as a primary gene name for pka(yfiQ) (Shaibe, 1985). Seven E. coli proteins, RcsB, RutR, McbR, RpsD, MltD, YcjR, and YbaB, were found to be Salmonella Pat(YfiQ) substrates modifiable by lysine acetylation in vitro using protein chips (Thao, 2010). RcsB is acetylated at Lys180 by purified E. coli Pka(YfiQ) in vitro, blocking its ability to bind to DNA, and Lys180 is deacetylated by CobB in vitro (Thao, 2010). pka(yfiQ) was named pat for protein acetyltransferase in Salmonella where it inhibits acetyl CoA synthase Acs by acetylating residue K609 (Starai, 2004). Acetyl CoA synthase (Acs) is activated by sirtuin homolog CobB-mediated deacetylation of K609 in Salmonella (Starai, 2002). More than 100 proteins have acetylated lysines in E. coli (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2008). CobB is likely to have a limited role in general protein lysine deacetylation since only four protein bands were changed in an E. coli cobB mutant (Zhang, 2008). A deletion of pka(yfiQ) did not prevent general protein lysine acetylation of the human chemokine RANTES when cloning in E. coli BL(21); instead, non-enzymatic lysine acetylation of isolated RANTES inclusion bodies by acetyl-CoA was demonstrated and non-enzymatic processes may also be responsible for general lysine acetylation of proteins in E. coli (d'Alayer, 2007). RNase R (Rnr) is de-stabilized by proteolysis in exponential phase relative to stationary phase due to Pka-mediated acetylation of Rnr Lys544 in exponential phase only (Liang, 2011).

ClpB exists in two isoforms, long ClpB(alpha)[ClpB93] and short ClpB(beta3[ClpB79], which is initiated from an internal GUG start at codon 149; both starts have been verified by N-terminal protein sequencing (Squires, 1991; Pontis, 1991). The dual translation initiation sites for ClpB have been confirmed using site-directed mutagenesis (Park, 1993). The N-terminal domain, present only in the ClpB long form, is required for efficient binding to protein aggregates and fully effective chaperone function (Barnett, 2005; Chow, 2005). Coordinated expression of both long and short forms of ClpB is required for the protection from thermal killing; the ratio of short form to long form ClpB is 0.4 to 0.5 under a variety of stress conditions (Chow, 2005). ClpB is heat shock protein F84.1 (Squires, 1991). ClpB is regulated by RpoH (Kitagawa, 1991). clpB is required for growth below 8C, which is enabled by transgenic Oleispira antarctica Cpn10/60.

The very poor growth of rluD deletions in all E. coli K-12 strains is due to their having a mutant prfB gene with Thr246 instead of the Ala246 or Ser246 found in all other E. coli and Salmonella strains; rluD deletions have little effect on growth or stop codon recognition in a prfB Ala246 background (Dreyfus, 2011; O'Connor, 2011; Schaub, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD mutants in E. coli K-12 is due to increased translational readthrough and can be suppressed by point mutations in prfB or prfC (O'Connor, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD prfB mutants in E. coli K-12 is largely due to rpsG translation readthrough (and polar effects) and can be suppressed by restoring the rpsG stop codon, which is mutated to a Leu codon n K-12, leading to a 23 aa extension of ribosomal protein S7 (Dreyfus, 2011; Schaub, 2011).

The first 22 aa of YfiR are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. The P. aeruginosa ortholog YfiN is an inner membrane-associated diguanylate cyclase whose activity is negatively regulated by the P. aeruginosa periplasmic protein YfiR; the P. aeruginosa OM lipoprotein YfiB counteracts YfiR inhibition of YfiN (Malone, 2010). YfiR might interact with the predicted N-terminal periplasmic domain of YfiN.
b2604	EG12880	yfiN	putative membrane-anchored diguanylate cyclase	Null	Predicted membrane-anchored diguanylate cyclase	YfiN has an N-terminal predicted periplasmic domain flanked by two TM segments and has a C-terminal cytoplasmic diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain. The N-terminal domain is probably a signal input domain because there is a HAMP linker signal transduction domain (residues 183-236) between the periplasmic domain and the GGDEF domain. The HAMP linker signal transduction domain is detected using EBI's InterProScan as matching ProSite PS50885, as annotated in UniProtKB P46139, but has an insignificant match to a HAMP linker Pfam profile (PF00672, E=0.15) using NCBI's CD-Search. The P. aeruginosa ortholog YfiN is an inner membrane-associated diguanylate cyclase whose activity is negatively regulated by the periplasmic protein YfiR; the P. aeruginosa OM lipoprotein YfiB counteracts YfiR inhibition of YfiN; P. aeruginosa YfiN regulates exopolysaccharide production (Malone, 2010).

A bamE(smpA) bamB double mutant is non-viable (Sklar, 2007). SmpA is homologous to P. aeruginosa lipoprotein OmlA. The first 19 aa of BamE are predicted to be a type II signal peptide. A mutation of Cys20 severely reduces bamE complementation of vancomycin resistance (Knowles, 2011). Although a direct biochemical demonstration that E. coli BamE is a lipoprotein appears to be lacking, the supporting evidence is very strong.

b2696	EG11447	csrA	pleiotropic regulatory protein for carbon source metabolism	Regulator; Global regulatory functions	Global regulator of carbon source metabolism; RNA binding protein	CsrA-mediated and ppGpp-mediated global controls are intertwined; it is proposed both that CsrA-mediated regulation is relieved during the stringent response and that the CsrA-mediated regulation fine-tunes the stringent response (Edwards, 2011). csrA is a conditionally essential gene; a csrA deletion mutant only grows on rich media if the glgCAP operon is disrupted; a csrA deletion mutant also grows on minimal media with pyruvate as the carbon source; the original csrA::kan insertion allele is interrupted at codon 51 but retains partial activity (Timmermans, 2009). CsrA translationally represses the GGDEF diguanylate cyclase enzymes DgcZ(YdeH) and YcdT, which are needed for normal motility (Jonas, 2008). Recombinant CsrA-His6 was N-terminally sequenced, but this does not Verify since translation start was forced at ATG: Met is not clipped: MLIL start. CsrA also postively regulates FlhCD post-translationally, and hence is required for motility. CsrA exerts reciprocal effects on glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis and glycogen biosynthesis. glgC mRNA-binding activity blocks GlgC translation.

RecA protein was initially observed as Protein X, a membrane protein induced after inhibition of cell division and DNA synthesis (Inouye, 1970). Protein X has been demonstrated to be the product of the recA gene (McEntee, 1977; Gudas, 1977; Emmerson, 1977; Little, 1977). Protein X (RecA) is transcriptionally induced by the inhibition of DNA synthesis to comprise 4% of total cell protein, 10% of which is membrane-bound (Gudas, 1976). RecA is an ATP-dependent dsDNA binding protein and is an ATP-independent, SSB-stimulated ssDNA binding protein, however the ssDNA-RecA complex is stabilized by NTPs (Gudas, 1976; McEntee, 1979; McEntee, 1981). The RecA C-terminal dsDNA binding domain contacts dsDNA at conserved residues W290, I298, G301 and K302 (Aihara, 1997). The dsDNA binding site of RecA also binds the displaced ssDNA strand (Mazin, 1998). RecA R244Q and K246N mutants are proficient in ssDNA binding but are defective in dsDNA binding (Kurumizaka, 1999). RecA does not bind to DNA with extensive cruciform structures, except in the presence of SSB. RecA-dependent autocleavage of the LexA repressor also requires ATP and DNA and signals the SOS response to DNA damage by inducing the LexA regulon. RecA-dependent autocleavage of UmuD is required for polV (UmuD'C) lesion bypass. RecA filamentation is inhibited by RecX. RecA-dependent autocleavage of phage repressors mediates prophage induction after exposure to DNA damaging agents such as UV irradiation. Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004).
b2700	EG12698	pncC	nicotinamide-nucleotide amidohydrolase; NMN amidohydrolase	Enzyme; NMN catabolism	Nicotinamide-nucleotide amidohydrolase; NMN amidohydrolase	NMN amidohydrolase is also known as NMN deamidase. PncC(YgaD) is the only one of three PncC(CinA) domain (PF02464) proteins that has NMN amidohydrolase activity; YdeJ and YfaY are inactive PncC homologs (Galeazzi, 2011). E. coli NMN amidohydrolase is required for the recycling of NAD (via PNC IV) catalyzing the deamidation of NMN to NaMN; unpublished results of S. Sirilan and B. Olivera were cited for the initial report of an NMN amidohydrolase activity in crude extracts of E. coli (Manlapaz-Fernandez, 1973). NMN amidohydrolase was partially purified, but the gene was not identified; NMN amidohydrolase has a native MW of 33K (and an observed pI of 5.3) indicating PncC dimerization; NMN amidohydrolase exhibits a pH optimum of approximately 9 (Hillyard, 1981). PncC is is part of the most active pathway, PNC IV, for recycling NAD in E. coli; a second pathway PNC VI is also present. The assignment of the gene name pncC was originally suggested for the NMN amidohydrolase structural gene in Salmonella (Foster, 1979). The pncC gene was mismapped twice in Salmonella. The initial mapping of pncC in Salmonella was based on a penicillin selection against wildtype that could catabolize NMN; mutants with a pnuA allele of nadR, whose enzymatic activity is required for NMN uptake by assisting in the nicotinamide riboside substrate conversion to NMN and release from the PnuC transporter (Foster, 1979; Kinney, 1979; Foster, 1987; Foster, 1990). A second misidentification of the Salmonella pncC gene occurred when a selection for NMN catabolism mutants identified a gene (aphA) with a metabolic activity required for NMN uptake, not the catabolic enzyme NMN amidohydrolase; the periplasmic AphA is required for the de-phosphorylation of NMN to form nicotinamide riboside, the PnuC transporter substrate (Cheng, 1995; Grose, 2005).

MltB cleaves the glycosidic bonds between the N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in murein. Slt35 is a soluble form of MltB with the lipid-anchored N-terminus cleaved after Phe39 during purification. The N-terminus of Slt35 has been identified by protein sequencing, but Slt35 is is an artifact of proteolysis during purification. The first 18 aa of MltB are a type II signal peptide.

NlpD is localized to the septal ring (Uehara, 2009). An nlpD single mutant displays a short-cell phenotype, 2.5 micrometers long vs 4.0 for wt, and a nlpD mutation exacerbates the envC mutant filamentous phenotype in an nlpD envC double mutant, from 2 to 12 septa/cell for the double mutant (Uehara, 2009). NlpD has an M23 metalloprotease domain. NlpD binds Congo Red dye, as does its homolog Haemophilus somnus LppB outer membrane antigen, which is also a possible virulence determinant. NlpD, YgeR, MepM(YebA) and EnvC have C-terminal LytM domains; mutating all four LytM domain genes produces a strain with a severe filamentous phenotype, similar to an amiABC triple mutant, of over 20 times the normal cell length and more than 70 times the normal amount of septa/cell, from 0.5 to 36 septa/cell; also similar to the amiABC mutant, the nlpD-envC-mepM(yebA)-ygeR mutant has altered morphology and delayed onset of lysis after beta-lactam antibiotic treatment (Uehara, 2009).

The UmpH(NagD) and UmpG(SurE) phosphatases degrade UMP to uridine in vivo (Reaves, 2013). A surE mutation is a specific suppressor of pcm stationary phase survival defects. The original surE mutant had a secondary rpoS mutation. The lack of survival in stationary phase was due to this cryptic rpoS mutation and clean surE mutants have no survival phenotype. SurE demonstrates nucleotidase preference for short chain substrates. otherPDB (T. maritima): 1J9J, 1J9K, 1J9L, 1ILV.

YgbT(Cas1) is a multifuncitonal endonuclease that can cleave linear ssRNA, ssDNA, short dsDNA (34-mer), and various branched DNAs such replication forks and Holliday junctions in vitro; ygbT mutants have increased sensitivity to DNA damage and have impaired chromosomal segregation; genetic interactions suggest Cas1 involvement in RecBC and RuvB mediated DNA repair (Babu, 2011). YgbT(Cas1) of P. aeruginosa is a metal-dependent DNA-specific endonuclease that makes dsDNA fragments around 80 bp long (Wiedenheft, 2009). OtherPDB (P. aeruginoa):3GOD. DUF48 member.

b2761	EG12634	ygcB	Cascade complex anti-viral R-loop helicase-annealase Cas3	Null	R-loop helicase-annealase Cas3, CRISPR-associated; needed for Cascade anti-viral activity	E. coli Cas3 is a bifunctional enzyme with two activities: (1) an ATP-independent magnesium-dependent model RNA-DNA R-loop annealing activity mediated by an N-terminal HD phosphohydrolase domain and (2) an ATP-dependent R-loop RNA unwinding activity mediated by a C-terminal DEAH helicase domain; these antagonistic functions are toggled by ATP levels; the Cascade complex can also promote R-loop formation (Jamieson, 2011). Unlike Cas3 from S. thermophilus, E. coli Cas3 does not possess HD domain-dependent endonuclease activity (Sinkunas, 2011; Jamieson, 2011). The Cascade antiviral complex is comprised of CasABCDE and short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and requires the helicase-annealase YgcB(Cas3) for activity (Brouns, 2008).

b2782	EG11249	mazF	mRNA interferase toxin, antitoxin is MazE	Putative factor; Not classified	mRNA interferase toxin, antitoxin is MazE; inhibitor of translation by mRNA cleavage	MazF is a sequence-specific (ACA) endoribonuclease, induced by amino acid starvation, but in a lon-dependent, ppGpp-independent fashion. MazE homodimer binds two homodimers of MazF. MazF inhibitory effects on translation is reversed by tmRNA. MazF-mediated cell death requires the NNWNN pentapeptide (called EFD for Extracellular Death Factor) appears to be derived from the zwf gene (residues 199-203) and ClpXP is implicated in its production; AsnA appears to be responsible for the NNWDN to NNWNN conversion; ygeO was thought to be required to generate the pentapeptide (in MC4100) but subsequent work demonstrated that overproduction of Zwf could suppresss the YgeO' mutant defect, indicating a secondary role for YgeO' (Kolodkin-Gal, 2007; 2008). ygeO' is an apparent pseudogene in MG1655 and in MC4100 as well, so the ygeO' pseudogene is not responsible for the failure of MG1655 to produce or respond to normal levels of ECD. The MazF ortholog of M. xanthus mediates programmed cell death during fruiting body formation (Nariya, 2008).

The previously reported exonuclease activity of YgdG(Xni) has been refuted due to copurification with ExoIII (Xth); purified YgdG(Xni) displayed no nuclease activities in vitro (Shafritz, 1998; Hodskinson, 2007). YgdG(Xni) binds Ssb (Hodskinson, 2007). YgdG(Xni) is homologous to the exonuclease domain of PolA (Sayers, 1994; Borodovsky, 1994). 3/19 YgdG(Xni) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007). Although both polA and ygdG(xni) deletions are viable, a double polA ygdG(xni) deletion strain is inviable (Fukushima, 2007). Although no nuclease activity has been demonstrated using purified YgdG(Xni), its homology to the PolA exonuclease domain, its DNA-binding ability, and its synthetic lethality with polA suggests that YgdG(Xni) might have in vivo exonuclease activity; perhaps needed substrates or co-factors were missing from the purified YgdG(Xni) assays (K.E.R., 2013).

The source of this likely error is unknown but the 2D gel spot identified as FucK may need further verification, i.e. more unique N-terminal sequence data, to resolve the discrepancy.

TcdA(CsdL) binds to CsdE, linking TcdA(CsdL) to CsdA; TcdA(CsdL) accepts sulfur from the CsdA donor directly in vitro, but CsdE might act as a sulfur relay protein in vivo (Trotter, 2009). TcdA(CsdL) is similar to the N-terminal domains of MoeB/ThiS protein adenylation/thiocarboxylation enzymes which are E1-like, ubiquitin-activating-like proteins, but TcdA(CsdL) lacks the probable zinc binding site found in MoeB/ThiS family.

MltA cleaves the glycosidic bonds between the N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in murein. Unlike Slt and MltB, MltA can use peptide-free glycan as substrate. The first 20 aa of MltA are a type II signal peptide. MltA forms a complex with MrcB and MipA.

AmiC is localized to the septal ring via its N-terminal septal targeting domain in constricting cells (Bernhardt, 2003). Divisome, non-essential. In amiABC triple mutants, thickened dark bands termed septal peptidoglycan (SP) rings appear at division sites, representing a cell division structure that accumulates when septal synthesis and hydrolysis by the AmiABC amidases are uncoupled (Priyadarshini, 2007). A mutant lacking five murein hydrolases (amiABCmltCD=MHD90) has a delayed lysis phenotype after beta-lactam treatment (Heidrich, 2002). AmiC is a verified Tat substrate (Bernhardt, 2003). AmiC has a predicted Tat-only (Class I) 31 aa signal peptide (Tullman-Ercek, 2007). Ize (2003) incorrectly report a predicted 33 aa signal peptide in the text, but correctly depict a predicted 31 aa signal peptide in Fig. 4A.

Overexpression of ppdA causes abnormal biofilm architecture (Tenorio, 2003). ppdA is in the flagella and motility regulon and is both FliA- and FlhDC-regulated; overexpression or deletion of ppdA does not affect motlity or chemotaxis (Park, 2001). ppdA is predicted to have a CRP-S promoter co-regulated by both Crp and Sxy (Cameron, 2006).

b2842	EG12361	kduD	2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase; KDG oxidoreductase; 20-ketosteroid reductase	Enzyme; Degradation of small molecules: Carbon compounds	2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase; KDG oxidoreductase; DKII reductase; 20-ketosteroid reductase	Purified E. coli KduD is a 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) oxidoreductase (2-deoxy-D-gluconate 3-dehydrogenase), also known as 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase, with a KDG Km of 30 mM; O. Hantz, Ph.D. thesis, Claude Bernard University, 1977, as cited by Tubeleviciute et al. (Tubeleviciute, 2014). KduI and KduD activities were initially determined in Erwinia chrysanthemi where they are required for pectin catabolism (Condemine, 1991). KDG is derived from pectin, a common plant heteropolysaccharide, although E. coli K-12 does not secrete pectinases or uptake pectin oligosaccharides and has only the core KDG regulon as compared to plant pathogens like Erwinia chrysanthemi, whose extracellular pectate lyases and intacellular oligogalacturonate lyase breaks pectin down mainly into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) monomers and to a lesser extent polygalacturonase-generated galacturonate; in E. coli K-12 galacturonate uptake and degradation is mediated by the ExuT permease and the UxaABC catabolic enzymes producing KDG, respectively, and DKI is imported by the KdgR-regulated KDG importer KdgT and catabolized to KDG by the KdgR-regulated KduID enyzymes, also producing KDG; KDG is converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by KdsK and Eda(KdsA) (Rodionov, 2004; Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, 1996). KduI and KduD activities were initially determined in Erwinia chrysanthemi where they are required for pectin catabolism; E. coli does not catabolize pectin (Condemine, 1991). The reversible KduD oxidoreductase converts DKII to KDG in vivo, displaying DKII reductase activity; the substrate for this reaction, 3-deoxy-D-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate (DKII), is also known as 3-deoxy-D-glycero-hexo-2,5-diulosonate, (4S)-4,6-dihydroxy-2,5-dioxohexanoate, or 2,5-diketo-3-deoxygluconate. KduI and KduD are inducible by galacturonate and glucuronate and are required for optimal utilization of galacturonate and glucuronate at high osmolarity, presumably substituting for salt-repressed UxaC; lactose catabolism generates intracellular hexuronates (Rothe, 2013). EC 1.1.1.125 (2-deoxy-D-gluconate 3-dehydrogenase) and EC 1.1.1.127 (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase) have 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate oxidoreductase and dehydrogenase as alternative names, respectively, leading to the previous misannotation of KduD as EC 1.1.1.125. KduD may be the hexuronate dehydrogenase required for hexuronate utilization at high osmolarity. KduD is a 20-ketosteroid reductase (a reversible 20-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.149) that catalyzes the in vitro reduction of a carbonyl group at the C20 position of steroid substrates with a hydroxyl group at position C21 including 11-deoxycorticosterone (11-DOC), 11-deoxycortisol (Reichstein's Compound S, RSS), cortisol, corticosterone, cortisone, and 21-hydroxypregnenolone; physiologically relevant Km values were determined for 11-DOC (0.23 mM) and RSS (0.19 mM) as well as low affinity substrate activities using the sugar substrates D-gluconate and 5-keto-D-gluconate (Hannermann, 2007; Tubeleviciute, 2014).

KDG is derived from pectin, a common plant heteropolysaccharide, although E. coli K-12 does not secrete pectinases or uptake pectin oligosaccharides and has only the core KDG regulon as compared to plant pathogens like Erwinia chrysanthemi, whose extracellular pectate lyases and intacellular oligogalacturonate lyase breaks pectin down mainly into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) monomers and to a lesser extent polygalacturonase-generated galacturonate; in E. coli K-12 galacturonate uptake and degradation is mediated by the ExuT permease and the UxaABC catabolic enzymes producing KDG, respectively, and DKI is imported by the KdgR-regulated KDG importer KdgT and catabolized to KDG via DKII by the KdgR-regulated KduID enyzymes; KDG is then converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by KdsK and Eda(KdsA) (Rodionov, 2004; Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, 1996). KduI and KduD are inducible by galacturonate and glucuronate and are required for optimal utilization of galacturonate and glucuronate at high osmolarity, presumably substituting for salt-repressed UxaC; cloned KduI alone was able to isomerize hexuronates in vivo, but the specific set of hexuronate substrates is unknown (Rothe, 2013). KduI is a prototype for a family of hexuronate ketol-isomerases in the cupin-like superfamily (PF04962) (Crowther, 2005). 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate is also known as 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate or 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI). The product of this reaction, 3-deoxy-D-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate (DKII), is also known as 3-deoxy-D-glycero-hexo-2,5-diulosonate, (4S)-4,6-dihydroxy-2,5-dioxohexanoate, or 2,5-diketo-3-deoxygluconate.

Pbl is homologous to virulence-related export proteins, e.g. IagB (S.t.), IpgF (S. flexneri), PilT (plasmid R64). This family may be involved in making holes in the peptidoglycan layer for macromolecular transport purposes. The first 24 aa of Pbl are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. Codon usage indicates pbl is an alien (horizontal) gene. Hypothetical reconstruction of an apparent frameshift mutation after codon 148 extends Pbl to 167 aa.

Stop codon 52 is translated as an X. YgeK is homologous to the Spi-2 regulator SsrB. Codon usage indicates ygeK is an alien (horizontal) pseudogene.

The yegO' pseudogene is a remnant of the type three secretion system (T3SS) pathogenicity island ETT2. 18 kb of ETT2 has been deleted from K-12, leaving 10 kb of the presumably non-functional T3SS ETT2 remaining.

The 3' end of ygeQ has apparently been deleted from the MG1655 genome. A stop codon at position 265 is translated as an X, although in all intact versions and in distant homologs, this codon encodes a conserved Gly residue. A 24 aa signal peptide is predicted for YgeQ.

b2870	EG13053	ygeW	putative carbamoyltransferase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Predicted carbamoyltransferase, substrate unknown	Although related to arginine, ornithine and putrescine carbamoyltransferases, YgeW is in a distinct clade, indicative of a novel activity (Naumoff, 2004). YgeW has been suggested to be an oxamate carbamoyltransferases (transcarbamylase) involved in purine catabolism (Xi, 2000). Oxamate, allantoin and other substrates were tested but purified YgeW had no activity on any of them (Li, 2011).
b2871	EG13054	ygeX	2,3-diaminopropionate ammonia lyase, PLP-dependent	Enzyme; Not classified	2,3-diaminopropionate ammonia lyase, PLP-dependent	Expression of ygeX is low but YgeX can function to protect cells from DL-DAP toxicity in minimal medium when overexpressed (Kalyani, 2012). The N-terminus of the overexpressed protein has been sequenced, but the natural RBS was not used so it is not a Verified protein; the initial Met is cleaved (Khan, 2003). The N-terminus of the native S. typhimurium YgeX has been Verified (Nagasawa, 1988).

b2876	EG13059	yqeC	putative selenium-dependent hydroxylase accessory protein	Null	Putative selenium-dependent hydroxylase accessory protein	Phylogenetic profiling correlates yqeC with selD and YqeC has been predicted to be a selenium-dependent hydroxylase accessory protein however there is no experimental evidence to support this prediction (Haft, 2008). YqeC is a predicted P-loop NTPase (IPR027417) possibly with a Mur ligase central domain (IPR013221).

A Tn insertion in ygfK is unable to reduce selenate to selenite; YgfKM-XdhD(YgfN) was proposed to be a selenate reductase structural complex but no activity could be detected (B��bien, 2002).
b2879	EG13062	ssnA	putative chlorohydrolase/aminohydrolase	Putative structure; Not classified	Required for early stationary phase viability decline; aminohydrolase related; negatively regulated by RpoS	A ssnA mutant has increased survival in early stationary phase and overexpression of SsnA slows growth and causes cells to have an enlarged filamentous cell morphology (Yamada, 1999). TIGRFam TIGR03314 notes that ssnA is restricted to genomes that also have a set of predicted selenium-depndent co-factors suggesting that SsnA may be involved in selenium metabolism. SsnA has been purified and shown not to have isoguanine deaminase activity (Hitchcock, 2011).

XdhD is a xanthine dehydrogenase homolog but probably has no xanthine dehydrogenase activity. A Tn insertion in ygfK is unable to reduce selenate to selenite; YgfKM-XdhD(YgfN) was proposed to be a selenate reductase structural complex but no activity could be detected (B��bien, 2002).

b2891	EG10762	prfB	peptide chain release factor RF-2	Factor; Proteins - translation and modification	Peptide chain release factor 2, RF-2; translation termination factor recognizes UGA and UAA; slightly defective allele	Although prfA is essential in K-12 strains, prfA can be deleted in E. coli strains with wildtype prfB function, either non-K-12 strains or K-12 strains with the repair of the presumably laboratory-acquired A246T point mutation in prfB (Johnson, 2011; Johnson, 2012; Ohtake, 2012). The K-12 prfB A246T mutation lowers the release activity of RF2 for UAA by five-fold (Uno, 1996; Dincbas-Renqvist, 2000). prfA can be deleted in MG1655 when 321 UAG stop codons are reassigned to UAA stop codons (Lajoie, 2013). The ribosome changes reading frame after codon 25 of the frameshifted prfB gene, an example of programmed frameshifting. The very poor growth of rluD deletion mutants in E. coli K-12 can be suppressed by a point mutation in prfB and a role in translation termination for the 23S rRNA helix 69 pseudouridines has been demonstrated (Ejby, 2007). The very poor growth of rluD deletions in all E. coli K-12 strains is due to their having a defective prfB gene with Thr246 instead of the Ala246 or Ser246 found in all other E. coli and Salmonella strains; rluD deletions have little effect on growth or stop codon recognition in a prfB Ala246 background (Uno, 1996; Din?bas-Renqvist, 2000; Heurgu��-Hamard, 2002; Dreyfus, 2011; O'Connor, 2011; Schaub, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD mutants in E. coli K-12 is due to increased translational readthrough and can be suppressed by point mutations in prfB or prfC (O'Connor, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD prfB mutants in E. coli K-12 is largely due to rpsG translation readthrough (and polar effects) and can be suppressed by restoring the rpsG stop codon, which is mutated to a Leu codon in K-12, leading to a 23 aa extension of ribosomal protein S7 (Dreyfus, 2011; Schaub, 2011). prfB is essential (Kawakami, 1988). The prfB mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of prfB in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009).
b2892	EG10830	recJ	ssDNA exonuclease, 5' --> 3'-specific	Enzyme; Degradation of DNA	ssDNA 5'-3' exonuclease involved in recombination	RecJ has been N-terminally sequenced, but the native RBS was not used to direct translation, so it has been removed from the Verified Set (Lovett and Kolodner, 1989). The GTG start codon has been confirmed by mutational analysis (Haggerty and Lovett, 1997). OtherPDB (T. thermophilus): 2ZXP, 2ZXO, 2ZXR.

b2896	EG13074	cptA	toxin of CptAB toxin-antitoxin pair	Null	Toxin of CptAB toxin-antitoxin pair	E. coli CptA(YgfX) can complement a Serratia sdhE ygfX double mutant, restoring synthesis of the characteristic red tripyrrole pigment prodigiosin (Pig), and may have an unknown regulatory role in E. coli (McNeil, 2012). CptA has an N-terminal membrane domain and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and CptA blocks growth when overproduced in vivo; the C-terminal CptA domain binds to and inhibits the polymerization of MreB and FtsZ in vitro; the mechanism for the apparent antitoxin activity of SdhE(CptB) during co-overproduction is unknown but SdhE(CptB) does not bind directly to CptA (Masuda, 2012). Although CptA is descibed as a toxin, it may actually be a toxic product, i.e. it is toxic when overproduced but serves an important non-toxin role when it is made at a tolerable level; it may be important to control the levels of toxic products in vivo and the apparent antitoxin activity of SdhE(CptB) may be a mechanism to limit CptB expression to avoid unwanted toxic effects, i.e. SdhE(CptB) co-expression has an anti-toxic effect, but SdhE(CptB) is not a true antitoxin (K.E.R.).
b2897	EG13075	sdhE	flavinator of succinate dehydrogenase; antitoxin of CptAB toxin-antitoxin pair	Factor; Energy metabolism, carbon: TCA cycle	Flavinator of succinate dehydrogenase; antitoxin of CptAB toxin-antitoxin pair	E. coli SdhE(YgfY, CbtB) can complement the growth defect associated with a Serratia ygfX sdhE double mutant; Serratia SdhE was shown to bind FAD and to facilitate the flavinylation of SdhA in vitro; an E. coli sdhE(cbtB) mutant has an inactive succinate dehydrogenase; the sdhE gene is significantly clustered with SDH subunit genes in bacterial genome sequences (McNeil, 2012). SdhE may also facilitate FrdA flavinylation (McNeil, 2013). CptA has an N-terminal membrane domain and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and CptA blocks growth when overproduced in vivo; the C-terminal CptA domain binds to and inhibits the polymerization of MreB and FtsZ in vitro; the mechanism for the apparent antitoxin activity of SdhE(CptB) during co-overproduction is unknown but SdhE(CptB) does not bind directly to CptA (Masuda, 2012).

b2898	EG12685	ygfZ	iron-sulfur cluster repair protein, plumbagin resistance	Null	Iron-sulfur cluster repair protein; plumbagin resistance protein; hda mutational suppressor; folate and tetrahydofolate binding protein	COG0354 family. A yfgZ null mutant grows poorly on minimal media, is hypersensitive to oxidative stress, and has reduced MiaB activity; YgfZ may remove the formaldehyde from Fe-S enzymes like MiaB by transferring formaldehyde to tetrahydrofolate (Waller, 2010). YgfZ binds folate and tetrahydrofolate and is dependent upon folates for activity (Teplyakov, 2004; Waller, 2010). ygfZ mutants grow slowly, especially at low temperature; the slow growth of ygfZ mutants is suppressed by an mnmE mutation (Ote, 2006). yfgZ mutants are sensitive to plumbagin and YfgZ is involved in plubagin degradation (Lin, 2010). ygfZ expression is induced by plumbagin (Chen, 2006). YgfZ is involved in regulating the level of ATP-dnaA; a null ygfZ mutation suppresses hda mutations (Ote, 2006). YgfZ is structurally similar to the enzyme dimethylglycine oxidase involved in the betaine catabolism pathway (DMGO) of A. globiformis (Teplyakov, 2004) . YgfZ has a yeast homolog, CAF17, that is a component of the transcriptional regulatory complex. YfgZ can form covalent dimers in vitro but the significance of this in vivo is unclear; Cys228 is the only critical conserved residue required for phenotypic complementation (Hasnain, 2012).

Overexpression causes filamentous biofilm formation. Divisome protein, non-essential. FtsN has been shown by FRET to directly interact with itself, FtsW, FtsI and ZapA (Alexeeva, 2010). ZapA has been shown by FRET to directly interact with itself, FtsN, FtsZ and FtsI (Alexeeva, 2010). 5/23 ZapA(YgfE) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).
b2911	EG30099	ssrS	Null	Null	6S sRNA inhibits RNA polymerase promoter binding; template for RNA-directed pRNA synthesis by RNAP; mimics an open promoter	ssrS is a non-essential gene. Deficiency and overproduction of 6S RNA (SsrS) both compromise long-term survival. SsrS is a template for pRNA synthesis, releasing itself from RNAP by pRNA synthesis, relieving repression; the pRNA is 14 nt to 20 nt (AUCGGCUCAGGGGACUGGCC), initiating at U4 of SsrS (Wassarman, 2006).

Characterization of the ArgK ortholog MeaB strongly suggests that ArgK is actually involved in protecting Mcm from inactivation and that ArgK may bind to Mcm. MeaB and Mcm are fused in some organisms. MeaB of M. extorquens binds and hydrolyzes GTP. ArgK is a homolog of the human disease gene MMAA, implicated in methylmalonic aciduria. argK is part of a four gene operon encoding enzymes converting succinate to propionate. ATPase, but not protein kinase, activity is reportedly required for arginine transport. ArgK does not have predicted transmembrane segments typical of a membrane protein.

b2936	EG11291	loiP	Phe-Phe periplasmic metalloprotease, OM lipoprotein; low salt-inducible; Era-binding heat shock protein	Enzyme; Degradation of proteins, peptides, glycopeptides	Phe-Phe periplasmic metalloprotease, OM lipoprotein; low salt-inducible; heat shock protein that binds Era	LoiP(YggG) is a low salt inducble, OM-attached periplasmic metalloprotease that has an intramolecular disulphide bind required for full stability and enzymatic activity of LoiP(yggG); LoiP(YggG) interacts with the periplasmic predicted metalloprotease BepA(YfgC), which is required for the OM attachment of LoiP(YggG) (L��tticke, 2012). YggG of K. pneumoniae is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease (Kuan, 2011). The heat shock protein LoiP(YggG) binds Era and mitigates the deleterious effect of overproducing mutant Era-1 protein (Huang, 2007). htpX, loiP(yggG), bepA(yfgC) and ycaL are paralogs. A gene disruption of loiP(yggG) does not cause growth defect (unpublished data, Y. Akiyama, cited in Sakoh, 2005). The first 18 aa of LoiP are predicted to be a type II signal peptide.

b2944	EG12122	yggI	Zn-dependent metalloprotease-related protein	Null	Zn-dependent metalloprotease-related protein, function unknown	YggI was named SprT and described as a regulator of the bolA gene in stationary phase in GenBank D83644 by R. Utsumi and T. Suzuki, unpublished, 1996, but nothing has ever been published so this might be incorrect. YggI appears to have a conserved Zn-binding domain found in many metalloproteases (Pfam PF10263).

Member of the m(3)U MTases family DUF558 and the SAM MTase alpha/beta knot superfamily. Exponential reduction in cell growth only observed when co-cultured with wild type. The N-terminal domain (1-72) resembles an RNA binding domain. RrmA and TrmL(YibK) are structural paralogs. otherPDB (H. influenzae): 1NXZ, 1VHX.

YqgF is an essential gene. YqgF has an RNase H-like fold and is related to the Holliday junction resolvases RuvC and RusA.
b2950	EG12978	yggR	putative PilT family AAA+ ATPase	Putative transport; Not classified	PilT family predicted AAA+ ATPase, function unknown	YggR belongs to the TypeII/IV secretion system AAA+ ATPase family of PilT/GspE-like proteins (Pfam PF00437). gspE, hofB and yggR are paralogs.
b2951	EG12979	yggS	UPF0001 family protein, PLP-binding	Putative enzyme; Not classified	UPF0001 family protein, PLP-binding; mutant has perturbed isoleucine/valine metabolism	A yggS mutant accumulates exogenous L-valine in stationary phase, accumulates 2-ketobutyrate in log phase, and has reduced availability of coenzyme A; the phenotypes of a yggS mutant can be reversed by pantothenate addition and can be complemented by wildtype yggS but not its PLP-binding site mutant deriviative; YggS has been proposed to be a regulator of isoleucine and valine metabolism (Ito, 2013). A yggS glyA double mutant is a synthetic lethal (Nichols, 2011). YggS is homologous to the N-terminal domain of alanine racemase but does not have racemase activity towards any of the 20 L- or D-amino acids (Ito, 2013). YggS is not required to help YggT in the K+ uptake rescue of TK420 (lacking K+ uptake systems Trk, Kup and Kdp) (Ito, 2009). YhfX and YggS are single domain proteins related to the N-terminal domains of both synthetic (Alr) and catabolic (DsdX) alanine racemases, which contain the covalently PLP-modified lysine residue N6-(pyridoxal phosphate)lysine; since YhfX and YggS lack the C-terminal Alr/DadX domains containing the L-alanine-specific binding site and proton-accepting active site, it is unlikely that these enzymes have alanine racemase activity. YggS has a covalently PLP-modified Lys36 N6-(pyridoxal phosphate)lysine residue (Sulzenbacher, G., Gruez, A., Spinelli, S., Roig-Zamboni, V., Pagot, F., Bignon, C., Vincentelli, R., Cambillau, C., unpublished PDB structure 1W8G, 2006). V. alginolyticus FkuA, a YggS homolog, confers K+ uptake (with FkuB, a YggT homolog) on E. coli TK420 (lacking K+ uptake systems Trk, Kup and Kdp) (Nakamura, 1996). yggS is in the MprA regulon (Marbach, 2012). 9/112 YggS peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed; 3/112 YggS peptide masses are consistent with some YggS molecules having the initial Met removed (Maillet, 2007).
b2952	EG12980	yggT	putative inner membrane protein; compensates for loss in K+ uptake	Null	Predicted inner membrane protein; compensates for loss in K+ uptake	Although V. alginolyticus FkuAB stimulates K+ uptake, YggT appears to rescue TK420 (lacking K+ uptake systems Trk, Kup and Kdp) without increasing K+ uptake, through an unknown mechanism (Ito, 2009). Chromosomal yggT is probably not expressed since low level plasmid-based yggT expression was required for the rescue of TK420 (lacking K+ uptake systems Trk, Kup and Kdp) (Ito, 2009). YggS is not required to help YggT in the K+ uptake rescue of TK420 (lacking K+ uptake systems Trk, Kup and Kdp) (Ito, 2009). V. alginolyticus FkuB, a YggT homolog, confers K+ uptake (with FkuA, a YggS homolog) on E. coli TK420 (lacking K+ uptake systems Trk, Kup and Kdp) (Nakamura, 1996). YggT is the prototype for a family of proteins of unknown function (Pfam PF02325); YggT is comprised of two tandem YggT motifs.

b2968	EG12988	yghD	putative membrane-anchored secretion pathway M-type protein	Putative transport; Not classified	General secretion protein M beta	An intact Gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) locus was functionally characterized in ETEC strain H10407 (Strozen, 2012). GspM proteins have a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal periplasmic domain. The yghFED(gspCLM-beta) operon appears to have suffered a deletion including the gspDEFGHIJK-beta genes (7403 bp) between the yghF'(gspCbeta) and the yghLM(gspLMbeta) genes. The entire operon from an enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli is present in Genbank AY056599.
b2969	EG12989	yghE	pseudogene, secretion pathway protein, L-type protein homology	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, general secretion protein family; L-type; C-terminal fragment	An intact Gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) locus was functionally characterized in ETEC strain H10407 (Strozen, 2012). The K-12 yghFED(gspCLMbeta) operon appears to have suffered a deletion including the gspDEFGHIJK-beta genes (7403 bp) between the yghF'(gspCbeta) and the yghLM(gspLM-beta) genes. The stop codon of yghF' was removed, fusing 12 C-terminal residues out-of-frame but overlapping part of the fused yghE' gene. The N-terminal 74 residues of yghE' were removed by the deletion event. The entire operon from an enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli is present in Genbank AY056599.
b2970	EG12990	yghF	pseudogene, secretion pathway protein, C-type protein homology	Putative transport; Not classified	Pseudogene, general secretion protein; N-terminal fragment	An intact Gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) locus was functionally characterized in ETEC strain H10407 (Strozen, 2012). The K-12 yghFED(gspCLMbeta) operon appears to have suffered a deletion including the gspDEFGHIJK-beta genes (7403 bp) between the yghF'(gspCbeta) and the yghLM(gspLM-beta) genes. The stop codon of yghF' was removed, fusing 12 C-terminal residues out-of-frame but overlapping part of the fused yghE' gene. The N-terminal 74 residues of yghE' were removed by the deletion event. The entire operon from an enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli is present in Genbank AY056599. The first 276 residues of YghF' are identical to the entire GspC-beta (YghF) of two enterotoxigenic ETEC strains of E. coli. The Genbank version of K-12's yghF' [gi:1789341] does not include the first 35 codons of this partial gene. It appears only the stop codon of the ancestral yghF was deleted, fusing on an additional 12 C-terminal residues. The yghFED promoter is active and the yghF gene is possibly functional despite the extra C-terminal residues present in the K-12 version of the gene, which are: YRLFCPPYWKKS. A CTG start codon 7 codons upstream is predicted to be the start codon since it makes a much better signal peptide, but since CTG is used so rarely as a start codon, this needs to be verified. The first 23 aa of YghF' are predicted to be a type I signal peptide.
b2971	EG12991	yghG	secretin (GspDbeta) OM localization lipoprotein pilotin	Null	Pilotin, required for secretin (GspDbeta) OM localization; part of defective gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) operon; OM lipoprotein	YghG(GspSbeta) was characterized as an outer membrane lipoprotein that functions as a pilot protein (pilotin) required for proper assembly and localization of secretin (GspDbeta) in ETEC strain H10407; YghG is apparently not homologous to other pilotins, e.g. P. aeruginosa PilF and S. flexneri MxiM (Strozen, 2012). The E. coli K-12 gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) operon has a large internal deletion including the gspDbeta secretin gene. The first 24 aa of YghG are a type II signal peptide.
b2972	EG12992	pppA	bifunctional prepilin leader peptidase/ methylase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Prepilin protein peptidase	The E. coli K-12 gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) operon has a large internal deletion. The K-12 PppA prepilin protein peptidase is able to process the K. oxytoca type IV pseudopilin PulG and the N. gonorrhoeae type IV pilin PilE and is translated at 37C and 42C but not 30C (Francetic, 1998). PppA is required for Gsp-beta function, as determined for the ETEC strain H10407 which has an intact gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) operon (Strozen, 2012). Assembly of the pseudopilus proteins (GspGK-beta) that presumably gate the secretin (GspDbeta) OM pore is proposed to require N-terminal processing by the PppA prepilin protein peptidase in intact Gsp (T2SS) systems; these pseudopilus protein genes are deleted in K-12 and thus its PppA prepilin protein peptidase may not have a native substrate anymore.

b2981	EG12999	yghO	pseudogene, IS-interrupted	Null	Pseudogene, N-terminus-truncated; IS-interrupted; N-acetyltransferase superfamily	IS5LO has inserted into the N-terminus of yghO at codon 8, deleting the first 8 codons of yghO as well as any genes that were between yghO and yghQ. For example, E. coli CFT073 has eight genes (c3712-9) in the yghO-yghQ interval. The IS5LO-interrupted yghO alelle appears to be K-12 specific, indicating it could be a laboratory-acquired mutation. The missing eight N-terminal amino acids of an intact 374 aa YghO are MIKIEKVI, as can be found on any of the many intact alelles of yghO in other genomes, e.g. yghO of E. coli CFT073 (c3711). However, YghO of CFT073 is annotated as a 402 aa protein; yghO(c3711) has an annotated start codon 28 codons upstream of the probable start site; other alternate starts upstream of the conserved site are annotated variously across E. coli genomes. The MI start, but not the upstream alternate start codons, is conserved in all three YghO orthologs, all of which are annotated using the conserved MI start: Serratia marcescens SMWW4_v1c32720, Shimwellia blattae EBL_c39850, and Erwinia billingiae EbC_37190. Curiously, of 45 non-K-12 E. coli genomes with YghO alleles, only one (strain LF82) annotates the conserved yghO start codon (LF82_3204). In K-12 there are three upstream in-frame ATG codons encoded in IS5LO that possibly could be used to express a hybrid 'YghO.

Gss has an N-terminal CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases) amidase domain (Bateman, 2003). The gsp gene name has been changed to gss to avoid conflicts with gspA-O. The physiological role of Gss is unknown.
b2989	EG13005	yghU	putative S-transferase	Null	GSH-dependent disulfide bond oxidoreductase	There is another possible start codon 16 codons upstream, but this upstream start codon is not conserved. Using MS analysis, 1/107 peptides matched the longer N-terminus, but despite this observation the current start is retained as the most likely start codon (Maillet, 2007).

Gpr(YghZ) has moderate glyoxal and glycolaldehyde reductase activity and a gpr(yghZ) deletion mutant is glyoxal sensitive (Lee, 2013). Gpr(YghZ) is a weak methylglyoxal reductase and Gpr(YghZ) overexpression confers increased resistance to methylglyoxal. AKR14 family.

b3009	EG11824	yghB	general envelope maintenance protein; DedA family inner membrane protein	Membrane; inner membrane; cell division	General envelope maintenance protein, DedA family; inner membrane protein	A yqjA yghB double mutant is sensitive to biocides and cationic compounds known to be exported by multidrug efflux transporters MdfA, EmrE and Acr; this hypersensitivity is exacerbated by mutations in mdfA, emrE and acrB; all double mutant phenotypes are suppressed by an mdfA clone; E39 and D51 of YqjA and YghB are required for complementation of the drug-sensitivity phenotypes (Kumar, 2014). One of the redundant function proteins YqjA or YghB is required for general envelope maintenance and for PMF homeostasis under various growth conditions (Sikdar, 2012). A yqjA yghB double mutant has a membrane defect causing a cell division defect at low temperatures and an osmoremedial growth defect at elevated temperatures (Thomkins, 2008). DedA superfamily proteins YqjA and YghB likely have redundant functions since only a double mutant has defects; DedA superfamily members yabI or yohD can complement the yqjA yghB double mutant when overproduced, but a dedA clone cannot complement (Thompkins, 2008). Induced by AI-2 pheromone. A yqjA yghB double mutant is defective in the Tat-dependent export of AmiA and AmiC (Sikdar, 2009). A yqjA yghB double mutant is complemented by the sole dedA family gene in B. burgdorferi bb0250 (Liang, 2010). The E. coli K-12 DedA superfamily (SNARE associated Golgi protein/PF09335) has eight paralogs in two families, the COG0586 DedA/YghB family (including the DedA/YabI/YohD subfamily and the general envelope maintenance protein YghB/YqjA subfamily) and the YdjX family (including the COG0398 YdjX/YdjZ subfamily and the COG1238 YqaA subfamily) (Doerrler, 2013; K.E.R.). The yghB promoter region binds FNR and yghB expression is activated by FNR (Federowicz, 2014).
b3010	EG13013	yqhC	transcriptional activator of yqhD	Regulator; Not classified	Transcriptional activator of yqhD; aldehyde sensor	Mutations in yqhC conferring constitutive activation of yqhD were isolated as glyoxal-resistant mutants; YqhC was shown to bind and activate the yqhD promoter (Lee, 2010). An IS10 insertion in yqhC confers furfural resistance; YqhC is a transcriptional activator of yqhD and dkgA(yqhE) (Turner, 2010). AraC family.
b3011	EG13014	yqhD	aldehyde reductase, NADPH-dependent	Enzyme; Degradation of small molecules: Carbon compounds	Aldehyde reductase, NADPH-dependent; glyoxal and glycolaldehyde reductase; AdhZ1; protects against lipid oxidation; glyoxal resistance protein; furfural reductase; contains Zn; homodimer	HT_Cmplx40_Cyt: YbgI+YqhD. YqhD is induced under conditions that favor lipid oxidation; overexpression increases resistance to paraquat, hydrogen peroxide and the lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes butanaldehyde, propanaldehyde, acrolein and malondialdehyde; yqhD mutants are senstive to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide (Perez, 2008). YqhD catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of acetaldehyde, malondialdehyde, propanaldehyde, butanaldehyde and acrolein in vitro (Perez, 2008). YqhD was reported to have no aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and to have in vitro alcohol dehydrogenase activity with a preference for alcohols longer than C3, however these results were later contradicted (Sulzenbacher, 2004; Perez, 2009). Mutations in yqhC conferring constitutive activation of yqhD were isolated as glyoxal-resistant mutants; YqhC was shown to bind and activate the yqhD promoter (Lee, 2010).

Verified Tat substrate: SufI has a Tat/Sec (Class II) 27 aa signal peptide (Tullman-Ercek, 2007). Overproduction of SufI titrates out the Tat translocon and mimics a tatC mutation. Multicopper oxidase homolog.

b3021	EG13022	mqsA	antitoxin for MqsR toxin; transcriptional repressor	Null	Antitoxin for MqsR toxin; transcriptional repressor	mqsA(ygiT) was identified as a multicopy suppressor of a carA deletion (Patrick, 2007). Toxin MsqR could not be cloned in an ara vector unless antitoxin MqsA(YgiT) is upregulated (Shah, 2006). MqsR destabilizes the MqsA repressor-DNA complex by tightly binding MqsA (Brown, 2012).
b3022	EG13023	mqsR	GCU-specific mRNA interferase toxin of the MqsR-MqsA toxin-antitoxin system; biofilm/motility regulator; anti-repressor	Null	GCU-specific mRNA interferase, toxin-antitoxin pair MqsRA; motility, quorum-sensing biofilm regulator; works through QseBC and AI-2; anti-repressor	mqsR is induced during biofilm formation. Toxin MqsR could not be cloned in an ara vector unless antitoxin MqsA(YgiT) is upregulated (Shah, 2006). MqsR destabilizes the MqsA repressor-DNA complex by tightly binding MqsA (Brown, 2012). Toxin endoribonuclease MqsR degrades ghoS antitoxin mRNA but not ghoT toxin mRNA, amplifying the GhoT toxin production as a stress response (Wang, 2013). MqsR induction increases GhoT production; GhoT is localized to poles and does not cause cell lysis during normal physiology but does impair membrane function, causing a reduction of cellular ATP and PMF energy sources, a lowered metabolism, and an increase in the number of persistent (dormant) cells formed in the presence of antibiotics (Cheng, 2013).

Induced 25-fold by 2-methylene-4-butyrolactone and 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione). mdaB is in an operon with ygiN. Reduces menadione to menadiol. May have some nitroreductase activity. Paradoxically also reported to be NADPH-specific.

b3035	EG11009	tolC	transport channel	Putative membrane; Cell division	Outer membrane factor (OMF) of tripartite efflux pumps; channel-tunnel spanning the outer membrane and periplasm; trimeric; ColE1 tolerance	tolC mutants grow poorly on minimal medium and have aberrant cell shapes; a normal phenotype is restored by adding iron; iron-starved tolC cells accumulate periplasmic enterobactin responsible for the growth defect (Vega, 2013). A mutant lacking ygiB, ygiC, yjfM, yjfC, and tolC has an exacerbated growth defect in mimimal medium and has increased antibiotic sensitivities relative to tolC-alone mutants; the phenotypic defects of the five gene deletion strain are complemented by a tolC plasmid; both the ygiBC and yjfMC deletions are needed to exacerbate the tolA phenotype indicating that YgiBC and YjfMC may have redundant functions; it is not known if all four genes need to be deleted to observe the tolC mutant phenotype exacerbations; tolC-ygiBC constitute an operon; the tolC growth defect on minimal medium is caused by inner membrane stress, induces PspA, and is reversible by serine (Dhamdhere, 2010). TolC, MdtQ, MdtP and CusC are paralogs.
b3037	EG11164	ygiB	DUF1190 family protein	Null	DUF1190 family protein, function unknown; helps mitigate tolC mutant defects; tolC operon	A mutant lacking ygiB, ygiC, yjfM, yjfC, and tolC has an exacerbated growth defect in mimimal medium and has increased antibiotic sensitivities relative to tolC-alone mutants; the phenotypic defects of the five gene deletion strain are complemented by a tolC plasmid; both the ygiBC and yjfMC deletions are needed to exacerbate the tolA phenotype indicating that YgiBC and YjfMC may have redundant functions; it is not known if all four genes need to be deleted to observe the tolC mutant phenotype exacerbations; tolC-ygiBC constitute an operon (Dhamdhere, 2010). YgiB was previously predicted to have a 35 aa type II signal peptide, however this prediction does not hold for the DUF1190 family; a reevaluation indicates YgiB might have either a signal anchor or a signal peptide (Gonnet, 2004).
b3038	EG11165	ygiC	ATP-Grasp family ATPase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	ATP-Grasp family ATPase, function unknown; helps mitigate tolC mutant defects; tolC operon	Gss, YgiC and YjfC are ATP-Grasp family proteins with ATPase activities, but only Gss has glutathionylspermidine synthase activity (Sui, 2012). YgiC and YjfC do not contain the CHAP amidase domain present in Gss. A mutant lacking ygiB, ygiC, yjfM, yjfC, and tolC has an exacerbated growth defect in mimimal medium and has increased antibiotic sensitivities relative to tolC-alone mutants; the phenotypic defects of the five gene deletion strain are complemented by a tolC plasmid; both the ygiBC and yjfMC deletions are needed to exacerbate the tolA phenotype indicating that YgiBC and YjfMC may have redundant functions; it is not known if all four genes need to be deleted to observe the tolC mutant phenotype exacerbations; tolC-ygiBC constitute an operon (Dhamdhere, 2010).
b3039	EG11166	ygiD	4,5- DOPA-extradiol-dioxygenase	Null	4,5- DOPA-extradiol-dioxygenase	YgiD is a monomeric 4,5- DOPA-extradiol-dioxygenase that converts L-DOPA to betalamic acid and muscaflavin but its native substrates are unknown (Gand��a-Herrero, 2013).

This RFN element 5' UTR has been reported in intergenic sRNA searches as sroG (Vogel, 2003). Attenuation of transcription at the FMN-bound riboswitch produces the 149 nt sroG sRNA, ending at 3182592. The experimentally determined RNA start for sroG is the start of the ribB mRNA. sroG is not annotated as a separate gene and the sroG transcript is part of the ribB mRNA. Mutations in the ribB riboswitch resulting in excretion of riboflavin were isolated as genetic suppressors of a rutE mutation allowing growth on pyrimidines at 37C (Kim, 2010).

The first ten amino acids of this reconstruction come from the other side of the IS2I insertion. Probable false positive lipoprotein prediction, Cys not conserved. YqiH (putative fimbrial chaperone), and YqiG' (putative fimbrial export usher protein) are encoded in an IS2I-interrupted putative fim operon.

The first 25 aa of YqiH are a predicted type I signal peptide. YqiH has Ig-like domains: pfam PF00345 aligns to N-terminal residues 26-144, and pfam PF02753 aligns to C-terminal residues 160-227. YqiH (putative chaperone), and YqiG' (putative export usher protein) are encoded in an IS2I-interrupted putative fim operon.
b3048	EG14230	yqiI	fimbrial protein	Structural component; Surface structures	Fimbrial protein, required for swarm motility; also required for flagellin production and methylglyoxal resistance	The first 21 aa of YqiI are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. YqiI (fimbrial protein, PF00419), YqiH (putative chaperone), and YqiG' (putative export usher protein) are encoded in an IS2I-interrupted putative fim operon. The C-terminal domain of paralogs yqiI and ybgO may be distantly related to FimA. An insertion in yqiI confers increased sensitivity to methylglyoxal and dihydroxyacetone in a gloA mutant background; yqiI mutants have reduced flagellin and impaired motility (Kim, 2007).

A glgS mutant has an elevated AMP level; AMP is a negative regulator of GlgC so the reduced glycogen in the glgS mutant is probably an indirect effect due to elevated AMP levels (Montero, 2009). GlgS does not affect transcription of the glg genes. RpoS regulon. cAMP regulon.

YqiJ was reported to be an NfeD/STOPP family protein by Chiba (2006). DUF1449 and NfeD may be part of a superfamily as a pfam Motif Scan of YqiK also hits the Nfed motif (E = 0.0029).
b3051	EG14232	yqiK	PHB family membrane protein, function unknown	Putative membrane; Not classified	PHB family membrane protein, function unknown	yqiK and yqiJ probably form an operon; PHB and NfeD/STOPP family proteins are often operonic. YqiK overproducing cells are enlarged and contain opaque cellular inclusions (H. Plattner, University of Konstanz, unpublished data cited in Hinderhofer, 2009). The PHB domain is also called the SPFH domain, named after the proteins Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin and HflK/C (Tavernarakis, 1999; Morrow, 2005; Rivera-Milla, 2006; Browman, 2007). YqiK belongs to subfamily SPFH2b (Hinderhofer, 2009).

b3053	EG11602	glnE	fused deadenylyltransferase/adenylyltransferase for glutamine synthetase	Enzyme; Proteins - translation and modification	Protein adenylyltransferase, modifies glutamine synthase; catalyzes adenylation and deadenylation	GlnE has two homologous domains: the N-terminal domain is the deadenylase, and the C-terminal domain is the adenylase (Jaggi, 1997).
b3054	EG11603	ygiF	inorganic triphosphatase	Null	Inorganic triphosphatase	Altough the inorganic triphosphatase YgiF belongs to the CYTH family of adenyl cyclases and thiamine triphosphatases, it has no adenyl cyclase activity in vitro and only a very weak thiamine triphosphatase activity; most of the inorganic triphosphatase activity in extracts is due to inorganic pyrophosphatase activity (Kohn, 2012).
b3055	EG12434	ygiM	SH3 domain protein	Null	SH3 domain protein, function unknown	YgiM has been detected as a membrane-bound homo-hexamer (Maddalo, 2011). The first 22 aa are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. IPR003646: SH3_bac family.

It also has metal-independent phosphodiesterase activity toward 2',3'-cAMP, -cGMP, and -cCMP (Yakunin, 2004).
b3057	EG11665	bacA	undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase	Putative transport; Drug/analog sensitivity	Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase; BacA(UppP)	Overexpression of bacA confers bacitracin resistance (Cain, 1993). Purified BacA has undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (UppP) activity, not the previously hypothesized undecaprenol phosphokinase activity; as bacA was the first of four UppP-encoding genes characterized, it was proposed to be renamed uppP which is retained as a synonym (Cain, 1993; El Ghachi, 2004). BacA(UppP) encodes 75% of the cell's UppP activity; the bacA gene is not essential, but UppP activity is essential to synthesize undecaprenyl phosphate, a C55 lipid carrier for cell wall synthesis, so a ybjG pgpB bacA triple mutant of three UppP-encoding genes is lethal; overexpression, but not wildtype levels, of the LpxT(YeiU) undecaprenyl pyrophosphate:lipid A 1-phosphate phosphotransferase activity rescues the triple mutant (El Ghachi, 2004; El Ghachi, 2005). YbjG and BacA are not involved in lipid A modification (Touze, 2008).
b3058	EG11673	folB	dihydroneopterin aldolase and dihydroneopterin triphosphate 2'-epimerase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Dihydroneopterin aldolase	The N-terminal sequence of native FolB(YgiG) is MDIVFIEQL (Jeff Green, personal comm.)
b3059	EG11674	plsY	putative glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase	Null	Probable glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase	Homologous to the PlsY glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (UniProtKB: P0A4Q0) of S. pneumoniae, which identifies a function for the UPF0078 family (COG0344). S. pneumoniae PlsX and PlsY work together as a two-step glycerol-3-phosphate acylation, the first step in phosphatidic acid synthesis, an intermediate in phospholipid synthesis (Lu, 2006). PlsXY homologs are present in E. coli, but PlsXY cannot substitute for the single step reaction catalyzed by the essential PlsB even on plasmids, although S. pneumoniae plsXY can plasmid rescue E. coli plsB null mutants (Yoshimura, 2007). plsY(ygiH) and plsX are synthetic lethals (i.e. they cannot be simultaneously deleted) and plsB overexpression permits growth of the plsXY double mutant (Yoshimura, 2007).

b3063	EG12393	ttdT	L-tartrate/succinate antiporte	Null	L-tartrate/succinate antiporter; needed for L-tatrate uptake and tartrate induction of ttdAB	TtdT does not transport D-tartrate and can uptake succinate, although excretion of succinate is favored. IT (Ion Transporter) superfamily (Prakash, 2003). TtdT is a member of the ST(3) structural class based on hydropathy profiles (Lolkema, 2003). YgjE was mistakenly identified as both YgjE and YgiE in the abstract for Oshima (2006), and thus ygiE is listed as a synonym for ygjE in TCDB. The real YgiE is now called ZupT.
b3064	EG11171	tsaD	tRNA(ANN) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification protein; glycation binding protein	Enzyme; tRNA modification	tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification; glycation binding protein	The modified tRNA nucleotide t(6)A37 is derived from the labile cyclized ct(6)A37 during extraction; the tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine dehydratase TcdA catalyzes the cyclization reaction (Miyauchi, 2013). TsaBCDE are necessary and sufficient for tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification in vitro (Deutsch, 2012). TsaD(YgjD) was proposed to be a threonine-bicarbonate ligase producing N-carbamoylthreonine which was proposed to then be transferred to the N(6) group of tRNA(NNU) A37 by TsaC(YrdC); TsaB(YeaZ) is required for the essential function of TsaD(YjgD) (El Yacoubi, 2011). Depletion of TsaD(YgjD) prevents tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification (Srinivasan, 2010). tsaD(ygjD) mutants accumulate toxic glycated proteins (Amadori-modified proteins); the accumulation of glycated FtsZ in TsaD(YgjD)-depleted cells may explain the genome maintenance phenotype and the unusual cell shapes of tsaD(ygjD) mutants (Katz, 2010). S. cerevisiae Qri7, involved in genome maintenance, complements a tsaD(ygjD) mutant growth defect in E. coli (Oberto, 2009). Loss of TsaD(YgjD) in E. coli causes small cell size and nucleoid loss (Obero, 2009). Depletion of TsaD(YgjD) causes a proportion of cells to be enlarged, with a peripheral distribution of DNA; the TsaD(YgjD) depletion phenotype is suppressed by multicopy clones of rstA (Handford, 2009). TsaD(YgjD) family proteins have been termed UGMPs (Universal Genome Maintenance Proteins) but this may be a pleiotropic phenotype primarily due to a defect in tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 modification (Oberto, 2009). (TsaB)YeaZ interacts with TsaE(YjeE) and TsaD(YgjD), preferring TsaD(YgjD); TsB(YeaZ) can proteolyze TsaD(YgjD) in vitro (Handford, 2009). TsaD(YgjD) is a homolog of a reported glycoprotease named Gcp, but TsaD(YgjD) does not have glycoprotease activity against glycophorin A and multicopy Gcp (M.h.) expression does not complement an E. coli TsaD(YgjD) deficiency, indicating that M. hemolytica Gcp and E. coli YgjD are not isofunctional orthologs; Gcp (M.h.) may not partner properly with the E. coli TsaB(YeaZ) protein (Handford, 2009). The identification of M. hemolytica Gcp as a glycoprotease was probably incorrect (Srinivasan, 2010). Since TsaD(YgjD) does not have glycoprotese activity and the homologous M. hemolytica Gcp is also probably not a glycoprotease, gcp was retired as the primary gene name for tsaD(ygjD). The tsaD-rpsUdnaGrpoD divergent operon promoter region binds ArcA (Federowicz, 2014).

Endonuclease IV stimulates Mug activity in vitro by promoting disassociation from the DNA and enzyme turnover (Sung, 2000). Mug can also excise a damaged basepair, epsilonC:G, containing 3,N(4)-ethenocytosine. Native Mug has been confirmed using mass spectrometry: 18670 daltons obs. vs 18673 calc. indicating that the initial Met is not clipped (Sung, 2000).

PatA(YgjG) also transaminates cadaverine and spermidine. A mutation was isolated, mapped to 89' and named pat that has 10% of wildtype putrescine aminotransferase activity (Shaibe, 1985). To distinguish the original pat gene which has not yet been mapped to an ORF from the structural patA gene it is refered to as patB(pat); perhaps the patB(pat) mutation affects PAT activity either indirectly or as a regulator. patA(ygjG) is regulated by RpoN and RpoS (Schneider, 2013; Kim, 2014).

One of the redundant function proteins YqjA or YghB is required for general envelope maintenance and for PMF homeostasis under various growth conditions (Sikdar, 2012). A yqjA yghB double mutant has a membrane defect causing a cell division defect at low temperatures and an osmoremedial growth defect at elevated temperatures (Thomkins, 2008). DedA superfamily proteins YqjA and YghB likely have redundant functions since only a double mutant has defects; DedA superfamily members yabI or yohD can complement the yqjA yghB double mutant when overproduced, but a dedA clone cannot complement (Thompkins, 2008).

No activity detected on peptidase substrates. Mutants are sensitive to multiple stress conditions. YhbO belongs to a protein family variously called the C56 peptidase family, the PfpI/HchA peptidase/chaperone family, or the DJ-1/PARK7 superfamily.

HAAAP family. The AroP (general aromatic) and TnaB (Trp, low affinity) permeases can also transport tryptophan. Mtr is the only indole permease, as determined by genetic analysis of growth on indole byTrp auxotrophs (Yanofsky, 1991).

Mechanism of DeaD 50S biogenesis differs from that for SrmB 50S biogenesis. DeaD stabilizes exposed mRNA, possibly by protecting or destabilizing secondary structure of RNase E sites. Cold shock-inducible; acid-inducible.
b3163	EG12371	nlpI	lipoprotein involved in osmotic sensitivity and filamentation	Putative regulator; Not classified	Lipoprotein involved in osmotic sensitivity and filamentation	The first 18 aa of NlpI are a type II signal peptide. The NlpI region from 62 to 163 aa has three TPR repeats. nlpI mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006). In Salmonella, an nlpI mutant shows increased expresssion of csgD, csgA and decreased expression of yjcC; a pnp mutant shows the opposite response as an nlpI mutant (Rouf, 2011). The nlpI promoter region binds ArcA and ArcA activates nlpI expression (Federowicz, 2014).
b3164	EG10743	pnp	polynucleotide phosphorylase/polyadenylase	Enzyme; RNA synthesis, modification, DNA transcription	Polynucleotide phosphorylase; exoribonuclease; PNPase component of RNA degradosome; cold shock protein required for growth at low temperatures	Four ribonucleases, Rnc, Rnr, Pnp and Rph, redundantly process the 3' 33 nucleotides of 16S rRNA (Sulthana, 2013). PNPase activity is modulated by citrate binding (Nurmohamed, 2011). PNPase activity is modulated by c-di-GMP and PNPase is in a degradosome complexed with DosCP (Tuckerman, 2011). Cold induction occurs by reversal of post-translational autoregulation. The pnp mRNA leader is cleaved by RNase III, allowing PNPase to repress its own translation. Mutation of Gly454 impairs autogenous regulation without affecting catalytic activity. Mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006). Pnp can add long polynucleotide tails to mRNAs terminated by Rho factor (Mohanty, 2006). The overexpression of the Pnp S1 domain suppresses the cold growth defect of quadruple cspABEG mutant strain BX04 (Xia, 2001). 3/836 peptide masses from MS analysis indicate that an upstream start codon is utilized, but this contradicts N-terminal sequencing data and the upstream sequences are not conserved (Maillet, 2007). In Salmonella, a pnp mutant shows decreased expresssion of csgD, csgA and increased expression of yjcC; an nlpI mutant shows the opposite response as a pnp mutant (Rouf, 2011).

Probably due to the slow growth phenotype of rpsO mutations, the rpsO mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of rpsO in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009).

The glmM mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of glmM in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). GlmM is an autophosphorylated enzyme (at Ser-102) is active form (Jolly, 2000). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004).

A folP deletion mutant grows very poorly in a rich medium unsupplemented by folate, although it is unclear if LB or 2X YT medium was used (Fermer, 1997). The folP mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of folP in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). The merodiploid folP duplication in the Keio mutants strains probably compensates for the lack of supplemental folate in the LB rich medium utilized to construct the folP mutants.

ObgE binds ppGpp and modulates the stringent response (Persky, 2009). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). ObgE(CgtA) binds SpoT and pre-50S ribosomes, ObgE(CgtA) increases ppGpp degradation by ribosome-associated SpoT, and an obgE(cgtA) mutant has an elevated ppGpp level during growth, but not during the RelA-dependent stringent response (Jiang, 2007).

Although SfsB(Nlp) has not been experimentally demonstrated to bind to DNA, its high similarity to the DNA-binding Ner protein and the transcriptional activation function of SfsB(Nlp) indicate it is a DNA-binding protein.

b3190	EG12796	ibaG	acid stress protein; putative BolA family transcriptional regulator	Null	Acid stress protein; predicted transcriptional regulator, BolA family; low abundance protein	A ibaG(yrbA) mutant is sensitive to acid stress; ibaG(yrbA) transcription is induced by acid stress; overexpression of IbaG(YrbA) improves acid resistance (Guinote, 2012). Overexpression of ibaG(yrbA), which is paralogous to the morphogene bolA, is toxic; an insertion in the upstream gene mlaB(yrbB) can be deleterious due to increased expression of ibaG(yrbA), which is why the non-essential mlaB(yrbB) gene does not have a kan insertion in the Keio collection (Malinverni, 2009). grxD mutations are synthetic lethal with mutations in the isc operon, suggesting that Grx4 is involved in an alternative FeS cluster assembly pathway; a similar synthetic lethality pattern was observed for the bolA-like gene ibaG(yrbA), but not for bolA (Butland, 2005).
b3191	EG12797	mlaB	ABC transporter maintaining OM lipid asymmetry, cytoplasmic STAS component	Transport; Transport of small molecules: phospholipids	Probable phospholipid ABC transporter, quinolone resistance; peripheral membrane protein, cytoplasmic; maintains OM lipid asymmetry; STAS subunit	MlaB may interact with MlaE to influence MlaE localization and activity; mlaB and mlaE orthologs are fused in some bacterial genomes, indicating they may interact. STAS domains are found fused to transport domains in sulfate transporters, are found in some anti-sigma factors, and may bind NTPs. Mutations in any one of the mla genes confers sensitivity to SDS-EDTA and lead to accumulation of phospholipid in the outer leaflet of the OM (Malinverni, 2009). MlaABCDEF is a predicted ABC import system that probably maintains outer membrane lipid asymmetry by retrograde import of phospholipids from the outer leaflet of the OM; mla defects are suppressed by overexpression of the pldA gene encoding an OM phospholipase that removes outer leaflet phospholipids under stress conditions (Malinverni, 2009). Overexpression of ibaG(yrbA), which is paralogous to the morphogene bolA, is toxic; an insertion in the upstream gene mlaB(yrbB) can be deleterious due to increased expression of ibaG(yrbA), which is why the non-essential mlaB(yrbB) gene does not have a kan insertion in the Keio collection (Malinverni, 2009). Mutations in mlaB have a hyperlethality phenotype when cells are stressed; MlaB is a protein that reduces the lethal effects of stress (Han, 2010).
b3192	EG12798	mlaC	ABC transporter maintaining OM lipid asymmetry, periplasmic binding protein	Transport; Transport of small molecules: phospholipids	Putative phospholipid-binding protein, periplasmic; may deliver phospholipids to MlaFEDB ABC transporter for import; maintains OM lipid asymmetry by retrograde import of lipids from the OM outer leaflet	Mutations in any one of the mla genes confers sensitivity to SDS-EDTA and lead to accumulation of phospholipid in the outer leaflet of the OM (Malinverni, 2009). MlaABCDEF is a predicted ABC transporter import system that probably maintains outer membrane lipid asymmetry by retrograde import of phospholipids from the outer leaflet of the OM; mla defects are suppressed by overexpression of the pldA gene encoding an OM phospholipase that removes outer leaflet phospholipids under stress conditions (Malinverni, 2009). The first 21 aa are predicted to be a Type I signal peptide. MlaC probably delivers phospholipids to the MlaFEDB ABC transporter, which has the additional MlaD putative periplasmic binding protein signal-anchored to the membrane.
b3193	EG12799	mlaD	OM lipid asymmetry maintenance protein; membrane-anchored ABC family periplasmic binding protein	Transport; Transport of small molecules: phospholipids	Putative phospholipid-binding protein, signal-anchored; periplasmic; MlaFEDB phospholipid ABC transporter; maintains OM lipid asymmetry	Mutations in any one of the mla genes confers sensitivity to SDS-EDTA and lead to accumulation of phospholipid in the outer leaflet of the OM (Malinverni, 2009). MlaABCDEF is a predicted ABC import system that probably maintains outer membrane lipid asymmetry by retrograde import of phospholipids from the outer leaflet of the OM; mla defects are suppressed by overexpression of the pldA gene encoding an OM phospholipase that removes outer leaflet phospholipids under stress conditions (Malinverni, 2009). A 28 aa signal anchor facilitates export, but the signal sequence is not cleaved, anchoring MlaD to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane (Malinverni, 2009). MlaD(YrbD) is encoded in an operon with ABC transporter homologs and is predicted to be an IM-anchored periplasmic phospholipid binding protein; the predicted periplasmic phospholipid-binding protein MlaC may chaperone the deliver of phospholipids to MlaD. Alternatively, MlaD may assist in docking the putative MlaC-PL complex to the MlaEF core transporter for direct transfer of PLs to the inner membrane. An mlaD(yrbD) mutation in Shigella is sensitive to SDS and affects virulence protein secretion (Hong, 1998).
b3194	EG12800	mlaE	ABC transporter maintaining OM lipid asymmetry, inner membrane permease protein	Transport; Transport of small molecules: phospholipids	Probable phospholipid ABC transporter permease; MlaFEDB phospholipid ABC transporter; maintains OM lipid asymmetry	Mutations in any one of the mla genes confers sensitivity to SDS-EDTA and lead to accumulation of phospholipid in the outer leaflet of the OM (Malinverni, 2009). MlaABCDEF is a predicted ABC import system that probably maintains outer membrane lipid asymmetry by retrograde import of phospholipids from the outer leaflet of the OM; mla defects are suppressed by overexpression of the pldA gene encoding an OM phospholipase that removes outer leaflet phospholipids under stress conditions (Malinverni, 2009). The Shigella vspABC(mlaFED) genes influence virulence protein secretion and intercellular spreading in the host (Hong, 1998). mlaE(yrbE) is required for swarming motility (Inoue, 2007).

MlaABCDEF is a predicted ABC import system that probably maintains outer membrane lipid asymmetry by retrograde import of phospholipids from the outer leaflet of the OM; mla defects are suppressed by overexpression of the pldA gene encoding an OM phospholipase that removes outer leaflet phospholipids under stress conditions (Malinverni, 2009).

LptC binds LPS in vitro and LptA can displace LPS from LptC, but not the reverse, consistent with an LPS export pathway (Tran, 2010). Depletion of LptC results in rifampicin/bile salts sensitivity, indicative of an outer membrane integrity defect (Sperandeo, 2006). LptC has an uncleaved signal anchor tethering periplasmic LptC to the inner membrane (Sperandeo, 2007, Tran, 2010). The failure to produce a viable deletion strain indicates that lptC is an essential gene (Baba, 2006). LptB has been reported to be essential based on depletion of ara-controlled expression (Sperandeo, 2006). The insertion of a minitransposon with an ara-inducible outward promoter at codon 134 of lptC(yrbK) has been reported to be viable but to exhibit a cold-sensitive growth phenotype, possibly due to poor ara-inducible expression of the downstream essential lptA(yhbN) gene (Serina, 2004).

LptA is localized to the periplasm (Sperandeo, 2007). LptA depletion results in rifampicin/bile salts sensitivity, indicative of an outer membrane integrity defect (Sperandeo, 2006). The failure to produce a viable deletion strain indicates that lptA is an essential gene (Baba, 2006). LptA is paralogous to LptD(OstA,Imp). The first 27 aa of LptA are a type I signal peptide. lptAB expression is RpoE-dependent (Sperandeo, 2007).

LptB depletion results in rifampicin/bile salts sensitivity, indicative of an outer membrane integrity defect (Sperandeo, 2006). lptB has been found to be an essential gene based on LptB depletion experiments indicating arabinose-dependent growth of an upstream minitransposon insertion with an arabinose-inducible outward promoter (Sperandeo, 2006). The lptB mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of lptB in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). lptAB expression is RpoE-dependent (Sperandeo, 2007).

The rpoN operon contains rpoN-hpf-ptsN-yhbJ-npr. ptsN is a multicopy suppressor of rpoE mutant lethality (Hayden, 2008). Dephosphorylated PTS system EIIA(Ntr) protein PtsN binds to and stimulates sensor kinase KdpD activity, increasing the levels of the cognate phosphorylated response regulator KdpE (Luttman, 2009). RpoE regulon. 5/28 PtsN peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed; 4/28 peptide masses indicate that occasionally the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). In E. coli strains with a functional ilvG, no ptsN nutrient phenotypes are seen, indicating that perhaps ptsN is not an organic nitrogen source regulator (Reaves, 2011; Ninfa, 2011).
b3205	EG12146	yhbJ	adaptor protein for GlmZ/GlmY sRNA decay, glucosamine-6-phosphate-regulated; NTPase	Null	Adaptor protein RapZ for GlmZ/GlmY sRNA degradation; glucosamine-6-phosphate regulated; NTPase	YhbJ(RapZ) is an adaptor protein that recruits GlmZ to the catalytic domain of RNase E; GlmY is an anti-adaptor decoy sRNA that binds YhbJ(RapZ) competitively with GlmZ, protecting it from degradation (G?pel, 2013). Unprocessed GlmZ sRNA bound to Hfq upregulates GlmS by causing an activating mRNA cleavage; YhbJ(RapZ) mediates the negative feedback regulation of GlmS by sensing the GlmS product glucosamine-6-phosphate and facilitating GlmZ sRNA decay, which now cannot mediate GlmS mRNA cleavage activation by RNase E (Kalamorz, 2007). The rpoN operon contains rpoN-hpf-ptsN-yhbJ-npr. UPF0042 family. YhbJ binds ATP and GTP and is an NTPase (Luciano, 2009). 2/85 YhbJ peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). The rap gene mnemonic is already in use for rapA.

b3208	EG12808	mtgA	biosynthetic peptidoglycan transglycosylase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Monofunctional peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase; monofunctional biosynthetic peptidoglycan transglycosylase; GTase; TGase	MtgA has flavomycin-resistant peptidoglycan synthesis activity (Di Berardino, 1996; Derouaux, 2007). mtgA is a non-essential gene (Schiffer, 1999). MtgA localizes to the division site and interacts with FtsW, FtsN, and FtsI in mcrA(Ts) mrcB- strains, indicating a role for MtgA in peptidoglycan synthesis related to the cell cycle (Derouaux, 2007). The use of the term transglycolase is ambiguous as it can describe both lytic and synthetic peptidoglycan activities, therefore glycosyltransferase is preferred (Di Berardino, 1996). MtgA lacks a penicillin binding domain and therefore is penicillin-insensitive. MtgA is a membrane-bound periplasmic enzyme that has an uncleaved signal anchor (Di Berardino, 1996). MtgA may be the glycan polymerase characterized by Hara (1984), although it has an apparent MW larger than MtgA (Di Berardino, 1996).

b3212	EG10403	gltB	glutamate synthase, large subunit	Enzyme; Central intermediary metabolism: Pool, multipurpose conversions	Glutamate synthase, large subunit; autoprotease	The N-terminal 11 aa propeptide of GltB is processed autolytically and the mature protein starts at residue 12, as confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing; an alternate start codon 93 bases upstream has been noted (Oliver, 1987). Although this upstream gltB start codon is preceded by an RBS sequence, the upstream protein sequence is not conserved and is interrupted by stop codons in Salmonella and other closely related bacteria. Cys12 acts as both the proteolytic nucleophile in the autocleavage event and the N-terminal cysteine active site for the glutamine amidotransferase activity; the 11 aa propeptide autocleavage is the only known proteolytic activity of the MEROPS family C44 proteases and the mature C44 proteases are devoid of protease activity (Rawlings, 2014). The yhcC-gltBDF divergent operon promoter region binds ArcA (Federowicz, 2014).

b3214	EG11514	gltF	periplasmic protein	Regulator; Central intermediary metabolism: Pool, multipurpose conversions	Periplasmic protein, function unknown	A gltF mutant has no phenotype with respect to amino acid utilization or ammonium transport; previous suggestions that GltF has a role in nitrogen-regulated gene expression are now unlikely. Although the GltF protein was overproduced using foreign translation signals, the detection of a signal peptide cleavage verifies the mature protein N-terminus. The precursor was also sequenced and the initial Met (MF) is not cleaved. The yhcC-gltBDF divergent operon promoter region binds ArcA (Federowicz, 2014).

The H. influenzae structures reveals a likely active site, proposed to be a copper-dependent sugar isomerase. yhcH is the last gene in the nanATEK-yhcH operon, but is not required for growth on sialic acid (Plumbridge, 1999).

Although the Cys is conserved, none of the homologs are predicted by LipoP to be a lipoprotein, so it is likely not to be a lipoprotein. NanE was just below the PATOSEQ cutoff for a lipoprotein prediction.

The SspA-mediated down-regulation of H-NS is needed for stationary phase-induced acid tolerance (Hansen, 2005). OtherPDB(Y.pestis):1YY7 (Hansen, 2005). SspA lacks GST activity and does not bind glutathione (Hansen, 2005).

Possibly because mutants grow poorly on kanamycin plates, an rpsI deletion is not present in the Keio collection, leading to its misclassification as an essential gene (Baba, 2006).

YhcB has been detected as a membrane-bound homopentamer, probably tethered by a single N-terminal membrane anchor (Maddalo, 2011). An outcrossed yhcB deletion from the Keio collection conferred reduced biofilm formation; a yhcB rodZ(yfgA) double mutant could not be constructed indicating that this is a synthetically lethal combination (Niba, 2007).

YhcN family.
b3239	EG12821	yhcO	putative barnase inhibitor	Null	Predicted barnase inhibitor	Barnase is a potent secreted RNase from B. amyloliquefaciens. Intracellular barnase is toxic but a barnase inhibitor, called barstar, binds to and inhibits barnase intracellularly. Barnase is a member of the N1/T1 family of RNases and E. coli does not have a member of this family so it is unclear what the barstar homolog YhcO function is.

YceF and YhdE are homologous to the B. subtilus Maf protein, a polar-localized, cell division-associated protein that inhibits septum formation when overproduced (Hamoen, 2011; Briley, 2011). The structure of the B. subtilus Maf has been determined; Maf binds two dUTP molecules in a cleft that may actually be a nucleic acid binding domain (Minasov, 2000). maf is mre-linked in B. subtilus and yhdE is downstream of mreBCD in E. coli and therefore yhdE is likely be the maf ortholog. 9/82 YhdE peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007). otherPDB (B. subtilis): 1EX2. otherPDB (B. subtilis): 1EXC.

Overexpression causes abnormal biofilm architecture, reduces motility and inhibits cell division. mreB is in an operon with mreCD and the Mre gene products form an essential membrane-bound complex responsible for cell morphology. Perhaps relevant to the controversial sitution in E. coli, in B. subtilis EF-Tu is found in a static helical structure at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane co-localized with MreB; MreB and EF-Tu interact in vivo and in vitro; reduction of intracellular EF-Tu affects cell shape but not translation efficiency; EF-Tu intracellular protofilaments may serve as tracks for dynamic MreB shape-determining filaments (Defeu, 2010). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004).

There is a very low level of CsrD expression and CsrD may work at substoichiometric concentrations (Suzuki, 2006). False positive lipoprotein prediction, Cys not conserved.
b3253	EG11315	acuI	putative acryloyl-CoA reductase	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Putative acryloyl-CoA reductase	acuI(yhdH) mutants are hypersensitive to acrylate (100-fold) and 3-hydroxypropionate (10-fold); AcuI(YdhH) is proposed to have a role in endogenous and/or exogenous acrylate detoxification (Todd, 2012). The acuI gene of R. sphaeroides has been shown to be an acryloyl-CoA reductase yielding propionyl-CoA (Schneider, 2012). A mutation in the acuI gene of R. sphaeroides confers hypersensitivity to acrylate and results in a reduced rate of acrylate metabolism (Sullivan, 2011). E. coli acuI(yhdH), R. sphaeroides acuI, and six other MDR012 genes are all able to complement the acrylate hypersensitivity of an E. coli acuI(yhdH) mutant, indicating their functional equivalence (Todd, 2012). AcuI(YdhH) is a member of the medium chain reductase/dehydrogenase (MDR) family, MDR012 sub-family. 3/148 AcuI(YhdH) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007).

DNA from a DNA methyltransferase deficient strain (dam-, dcm-, EcoK-) does not react with anti-N6-methylA or anti-N4-methylC antibodies when YhdJ is expressed from the pBR322 Tet promoter; the yhdJ-containing pBR322 derivative was not resistant to a variety of restriction (personal communication: R.

b3279	EG12838	yrdA	bacterial transferase hexapeptide domain protein	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Bacterial transferase hexapeptide domain protein; function unknown, low abundance protein	The observed MW of YrdA is 19 kDa, consistent with the ALT_INIT. YrdA is related to gamma class carbonic anhydrases, but does not possess significant carbonic anhydrase activity (Park, 2012). YrdA is a member of the hexapeptide repeat acetyltransferase superfamily. yrdA is paralogous to paaY and caiE. 1/89 YrdA peptide masses from MS analysis indicate that an upstream start codon at -72 is utilized, but the upstream sequences are not conserved and the reported cleavage of the initial Met, which is followed by a Lys, is unusual; in addition, the observed MW is inconsistent with the 72 aa extension (Maillet, 2007).

b3282	EG12840	tsaC	tRNA(ANN) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification protein, threonine-dependent ADP-forming ATPase	Enzyme; tRNA modification	tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification; threonine-dependent ADP-forming ATPase	The modified tRNA nucleotide t(6)A37 is derived from the labile cyclized ct(6)A37 during extraction; the tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine dehydratase TcdA catalyzes the cyclization reaction (Miyauchi, 2013). TsaBCDE are necessary and sufficient for tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification in vitro (Deutsch, 2012). TsaC(YrdC) has in vitro threonine-dependent ATPase activity generating AMP (Deutsch, 2012). TsaD(YgjD) was proposed to be a threonine-bicarbonate ligase producing N-carbamoylthreonine which was proposed to then be transferred to the N(6) group of tRNA(NNU) A37 by TsaC(YrdC) (El Yacoubi, 2011). TsaC(YrdC) but not paralog YciO is required for synthesis of t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine of ANN decoding tRNA(NNU)s (El Yacoubi, 2009). TsaA paralog YciO does not complement a tsaC(yrdC) mutational defect in t(6)A37 synthesis (Gerdes, 2011). TsaC(YrdC) efficiently binds to unmodified but not modified uncharged tRNA (El Yacoubi, 2009; Harris, 2011). TsaC(YrdC) was proposed to be a threonylcarbamoyl transferase subunit and part of a heteromultimeric complex as it binds unmodified tRNA, threonine and ATP (Harris, 2011). A tsaC(yrdC) deletion suppresses a prfA mutation and can only survive in a prfA mutant. tsaC(yrdC) mutants were observed to be defective in ribosome maturation and was named rimN, but this could be a secondary effect due to its essential role in tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 modification (Kaczanowska, 2005).

An insertion in yrdD suppresses the severe growth defect of a rdgB recA double mutant, indicating that YrdD might be involved in the removal of non-canonical DNA precursors (Budke, 2010). YrdD has three copies of a DNA-binding zinc finger motif (PF01396) also found in the C-terminal domain of topoisomerase I (Tse-Dinh, 1988; Ahumada, 1998; Finn, 2013).

TrkA has two complete TrkA(RCK) domains. SapD(TrkE) is required for TrkAH activity and stimulates TrkAG transport rate (Bossemeyer, 1989; Dosch, 1991; Harms, 2001). Trk-mediated transport is driven by proton motive force, but requires a high ATP concentration for maximal activity, presumably because ATP-binding is needed to activate SapD (Harms, 2001). Anaerobically, TrkAH is proposed to form a membrane supercomplex with the F0F1 ATPase and formate-hydrogen lyase (HycB-HycE-FdhF) responsible for hydrogen gas production and 2H+/K+ exchange; thiol groups are required for this activity (Trchounian, 2000). otherPDB(V.parahaemolyticus): 4J9U; 4J9V (Cao, 2013).

GspB has a single predicted N-terminal transmembrane segment (28-50), followed by a predicted periplasmic domain, which may interact with GspA. GspA may interact with GspB. A divergon is a regulon comprised of two adjacent divergent operons or genes. gspB was initially identified as an ORF that might be the 11.3 kDa PinO protein synthesized in the absence of isoleucine in relA stains (Guzman, 1991). But GspB is predicted to be 15.9 kDa and has isoleucine residues and there is no evidence that gspB encodes the PinO peptide or that it binds calcium. No homology to calmodulin or other calcium-binding proteins is predicted. gspB may have been mistaken for pinO due to use of a downstream ATG as start codon, but the 11 kD C-terminal fragment does have an Ile reside in it, making gspB inconsistent with pinO. pioO was the prior gene name assigned to pinO since the gene name pin was already taken.

The only amino acid difference between TufA and TufB is the last amino acid, G394 in TufA and S394 in TufB. EF-Tu lysines K38, K177, K249, K253, K295 and K314 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011). EF-Tu lysines K177, K188, K209 and K314 can be modified to N6-acetyllysine (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2009). HipA binds and was reported to phosphorylate EF-Tu residue Thr-383 in vitro (Schumacher, 2009). HipA is not EF-Tu kinase (Germain, 2013). The phage P1 toxin Doc phosphorylates EF-Tu in vitro at Thr383, blocking its ability to bind aminoacylated tRNAs (Castro-Roa, 2013). EF-Tu can be modified at K57 to either N6-monomethyllysine or N6,N6-dimethyllysine; the methyltransferases responsible for these modifications are unknown (L'Italien, 1979; G.F.-L. Ames, 1979). Methylation of EF-Tu at K57 impedes GTP hydrolysis in vitro (Van Noort, 1986). Nutrient starvation promotes the conversion of N6-monomethyllysine to N6,N6-dimethyllysine at K57 in E. coli B EF-Tu (Young, 1990; Young, 1991). tufA encodes an essential function, with duplicate gene tufB, such that tufA or tufB can be deleted, but the double mutant is inviable. Coliphage Q beta replicase is comprised of the phage-encoded beta subunit and three bacterial proteins: TufB, Tsf and RpsA (Kondo, 1970; Kamen, 1970; Blumenthal, 1972; Wahba, 1974). RpsA is dispensible for RNA synthesis by coliphage Q beta replicase and is not part of the core replicase (Kamen, 1972; Hori, 1974; Landers, 1974). 50-80% of EF-Tu can be located at the cytoplasmic membrane, possibly as a result of nutrient stress, and EF-Tu may have a ribosome-independent role since it is present in at least a four-fold molar excess over ribosomes; methylation status of K57 may be related to membrane localization (Jacobson, 1976; Young, 1991). Various mutants and growth conditions have demonstrated that EF-Tu, or a precursor form pTu, can be localized to the outer membrane (Dombou, 1981; Lifson, 1986; Sedgwick, 1986). EF-Tu can form filamentous structures in vitro and has been suggested to be an actin-like cytoskeletal protein (Minkoff, 1975; Minkoff, 1976; Rosenbusch, 1976; Jacobson, 1976; Minkoff, 1977; Beck, 1978; Wurtz, 1978; Beck, 1979; Cremers, 1981; Schilstra, 1986; Helms, 1995; Helms, 1996; Norris, 2007). Although early results indicated a lack of an in vivo EF-Tu cytoskeletal structure in E. coli, subsequent experiments identified a helically organized EF-Tu-containing intracellular protofilament near the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane with polysomes attached; it was suggested that an EF-Tu-containing cytoskeletal web might be the original prokaryotic cytoskeleton and that MreB evolved later to build upon the EF-Tu cytoplasmic network and be a cell shape determinant (Schilstra, 1984; Mayer, 2003; Mayer, 2006). In B. subtilis, EF-Tu is found in a static helical structure at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane co-localized with MreB; MreB and EF-Tu interact in vivo and in vitro; reduction of intracellular EF-Tu affects cell shape but not translation efficiency; EF-Tu intracellular protofilaments may serve as tracks for dynamic MreB shape-determining filaments (Defeu, 2010).

b3341	EG10906	rpsG	30S ribosomal subunit protein S7	Structural component; Ribosomal proteins - synthesis, modification	30S ribosomal subunit protein S7, mutated stop codon	The rpsG gene of K-12 has a mutation converting its stop codon to a Leu codon and extending S7 by 23 amino acids (Reinbolt, 1979). The extended rpsG UGA stop codon in K-12 is poorly recognized and an rluD mutation causes a severe growth defect in K-12 due to UGA readthrough and SsrA tagging; the rluD defect is further exacerbated by a prfB mutation also specific to K-12 (Dreyfus, 2011; Schaub, 2011).

YcaO is required for the efficient in vivo RimO-dependent beta-methylthiolation of ribosomal protein S12 (RpsL) on Asp-89 (Strader, 2011). Asp-88 of the mature RpsL is Asp-89 of the unmodified protein. RpsL lysine K108 can be modifed to N6-acetyllysine (Zhang, 2009). Mutations in regions 41-45 (except when Lys42 is replaced with Arg), 87-93 and 53 result in streptomycin resistance. A point mutation at basepair 262 from A to G sustains protein synthesis in late stationary phase and increases the stability of the 70S complex in low magnesium concentrations.

The B. schoenbuchensis YhfG homolog antitoxin VhpA binds to and inhibits the adenylyltransferase toxin VhpT that is homologous to Fic (Engel, 2012). Fic/YhfG may constitute a toxin/antitoxin pair (Yamaguchi, 2011). Fic is related to the phage P1 protein kinase toxin Doc (Pfam PF02661) and contains a variant Fido domain (HxFx[D/E]GSGLxxR) that could have either protein kinase or adenosine monophosphate-protein transferase activity (Kinch, 2009; Engel, 2012; Castro-Roa, 2013). fic is RpoS-regulated during stationary phase (Tanaka, 1993; Utsumi, 1993; Tanaka, 1995; Utsumi, 1995; Miksch, 1995).

b3388	EG11183	damX	cell division protein that binds to the septal ring	Putative membrane; Cell division	Cell division protein, binds septal ring; bile salts resistance	A damX mutant is bile-sensitive, as is a downstream dam mutant, but the damX phenotype is complemented by a damX clone indicating it is not a polar effect on dam (Arends, 2010). Overexpression of DamX induces cell filamentation (Lyngstadaas, 1995). Overexpression of DamX causes filamentous biofilm formation (Tenorio, 2003). DamX has a 100 aa cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane region, and a C-terminal SPOR domain. DamX localizes to the septal ring, via the SPOR domain, and damX mutants are defective in cell division (Gerding, 2009; Arends, 2010). DamX interacts with FtsQ and other cell division proteins in a bacterial two-hybrid assay and may be a negative regulator of FtsQ function (Arends, 2010). HT_Cmplx49_Mem: DamX+BamA.

The N-terminal transglycosylase activity polymerizes the glycan backbone and is penicillin-insensitive. The C-terminal transpeptidase activity crosslinks the muramic peptides and is penicillin-sensitive. Several phenotypes were associated with an mrcA deletion strain that inadvertantly deleted two neighboring genes, nudE(yrfE) and yrfF. One or both of these other genes turned out to be responsible for the observed mrcA-associated phenotypes. Murein polymerase is an essential function satisfied by either MrcA or MrcB. MrcA contains a PDZ domain involved in substrate recognition. MrcA is a membrane-bound periplasmic enzyme that has an uncleaved signal anchor.

b3398	EG12927	yrfF	putative RcsCDB-response attenuator, inner membrane protein	Putative factor; Not classified	Putative RcsCDB-response attenuator; inner membrane protein	The Salmonella YrfF ortholog IgaA attenuates the envelope stress response of the RcsCDB signalling system; yrfF is essential unless rcsCDB is deleted (non-mucoid yrfF mutants) or RcsCDB colanic acid production is reduced to a non-lethal level by other suppressor mutations (mucoid yrfF mutants); the rcs genes and yrfF tend to co-occur in genomes, suggesting they function together (Mariscotti, 2008). An IS1 mutation in the promoter region of yrfF, which may cause a reduction but not elimination of YrfF, in the E. coli MC4100 K-12 strain causes mucoidy and macrophage-resistance (pathoadaptation) (Miskinyte, 2013). yrfF is classified as an essential gene in E. coli because of the inability to construct a deletion mutant of yrfF (Baba, 2006). As part of a global transposon footprinting, two insertions in yrfF were found, leading the authors to categorize yrfF as a non-essential gene; these insertions may still allow for a partially functional YrfF protein, or they may have acquired suppressor mutations reducing or eliminating colanic acid production (Gerdes, 2003). YrfF is related to UmoB(P.m.) which upregulates flhDC in P. mirabilis. The Salmonella yrfF ortholog igaA is also called mucM, due to its mucoid mutant phenotype. The nudE-yrfF divergent operon promoter region binds ArcA and ArcA activates yrfF expression (Federowicz, 2014).

Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). Mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006).

b3407	EG12932	yhgF	putative transcriptional accessory factor; ionizing radiation survival protein; putative nucleic acid-binding protein	Putative factor; Not classified	Putative transcription accessory factor; ionizing radiation survival protein; putative nucleic acid-binding protein; low abundance protein	A yhgF mutation is one of many selected in a strain evolved for resistance to high levels of ionizing radiation; a single yhgF deletion mutant has about a ten-fold drop in survival after radiation exposure as compared to a yhgF+ strain (Byrne, 2014). yhgF expression is repressed during biofilm formation (Ren, 2004). The yhgF gene is orthologous to the essential B. pertussis tex (toxin expression) transcription factor gene that negatively regulates toxin production (Fuchs, 1996). YhgF is homologous to the essential yeast transcription elongation factor Spt6, which is conserved from yeast to humans, and the human ortholog has a role in HIV pathogenesis (Close, 2001). A high-throughput screen for new virulence factors identified the P. aeruginosa tex/yhgF gene as being required for rat lung infection (Potvin, 2003). The S. pneumoniae Tex/YhgF ortholog is not required for growth or pneumolysin expression; a tex/yhgF deletion mutant is out-competed by a wild type strain in culture; purified S. pneumoniae Tex/YhgF binds RNA and DNA (He, 2006). Purified C. perfringens Tex/YhgF binds a subset of toxin mRNAs and a tex deletion strain grows normally but has reduced toxin expression (Abe, 2010). Purified Tex/YhgF from P. aeruginosa binds ssDNA more than ten-fold tighter than it binds ssDNA, dsDNA or dsRNA but does not have nuclease activity; Tex/YhgF also binds a DNA/RNA hybrid; nucleic acid binding required the S1 domain although the weak binding to short ssRNAs indicates that the other potential nucleic acid binding domains also participate in nucleic acid binding; it appears that dsDNA binding by the variant HTH domain would be occluded by the rest of the protein although ssRNA-binding is possible (Johnson, 2008). YhgF is highly conserved; sequences, motifs, and structures identify six domains in the Tex family proteins, here defined by serial non-overlapping matches to five InterPro signatures; both the InterPro and the parent database profile accessions are provided: (1) a potential DNA-binding N-terminal HTH structural domain (IPR023319, CATH 1.10.10.650; residues 2-110), (2) a Tex-specific domain (IPR023323, CATH 1.10.3500.10; residues 111-322), (3) a YqgF/RNaseH-like domain that lacks a critical carboxylate active site residue but may still bind DNA/RNA hybrids (IPR012337; Superfamily SSF53098; residues 323-469), (4) tandem RuvA domain 2-like domains each with two potentially nucleic acid-binding helix-hairpin-helix motifs for a total of four HhH tandem motifs; the second HhH pair is not detected by any of the Pfam HhH family motifs and are not well-formed in the P. aeruginosa YhgF structures (IPR010994, Superfamily SSF47781; 470-558, 560-632), and (5) a highly conserved S1 domain with a nucleic acid-binding OB-fold (IPR012340, Superfamily SSF50249, 638-723). The N-terminal HTH domain of YhgF, which was identified in the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa YhgF but was not predicted by sequence analysis, is not similar to MtlR as previously proposed; the V. parahaemolyticus MtlR crystal structure reveals no HTH domain (Fuchs, 1996; Johnson, 2008; Tan, 2009). otherPDB(P. aeruginosa): 3BZC,3BZK (Johnson, 2008). otherPDB(P. aeruginosa): 2OCE (Jin, X.,?Min, T.,?Burley, S.K.,?and Shapiro, L., 2007, unpublished).

Signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) protein. ATP hydrolysis is not required for transcription activation (Richet, 1989), but is required to recycle back to the inactive form, which has ADP, not ATP bound (Marquenet, 2007). MalY (Clausen, 2000; Schreiber, 2000), MalK (Reyes, 1988; Panagiotidis, 1998; Bohm, 2002) and Aes (Joly, 2002) negatively regulate MalT activity by binding and blocking maltotriose activation.

RtcB and RtcA are proposed to work together as heal and seal enzymes, respectively, of a RNA repair pathway (Tanaka, 2011). The human RtcB ortholog, HSPC117, is the essential subunit of a human tRNA splicing ligase complex (Popow, 2011). The archaeal RtcB is a component of tRNA maturation (Englert, 2011).

b3427	EG14434	yzgL	pseudogene, periplasmic solute binding protein homology	Null	Pseudogene, C-terminal solute binding domain	YzgL encodes the first 73/501 aa; a full length YzgL from EAEC strain 55989 is in SP B7L4V9. B7L4V9 is 505 aa and starts at an ATG 4 codons upstream, but this upstream start codon has no RBS associated with it. The C-terminal domain of full-length YzgL belongs to the PstS superfamily of solute binding domains found in both periplasmic binding proteins and in LysR family transcriptional regulators. The N-terminal domain of full-length YzgL has no CDD hits with E values < 0.01, but the two best hits suggest that the N-terminal domain is not a DNA-binding domain, but rather the permease component of a transport system, possibly an ion transporter. These CDD (at NCBI) hits are to (1) COG2998 (TupB), weakly predicting (E = 0.02) that this domain is related to the permease component of an ABC-type tungstate transport system, and (2) COG3263, weakly predicting (E = 0.10) that this domain is related to NhaP-type Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiporters. Full-length YzgL may be a hydrid transporter with an N-terminal integral membrane domain and a C-terminal periplasmic solute-binding domain. Consistent with this interpretation, TMHMM predicts five transmembrane segments (TMs) in the first 203 residues and no TMs in the C-terminal 300 residues, whci is predicted by TMHMM to be outside (periplasmic). Signal-P HMM predicts a 22 signal peptide, but this may be a false positive due to an N-terminal transmembrane region. The yzgL' pseudogene is preceded by a putative attenuator structure.

Monomeric PanM binds to tetrameric PanD and accelerates PanD self-activation by autocleavage at Ser25 in vivo and in vitro; plasmid overexpression of panD overcomes the pantothentate requirement of panM mutants; PanM(YhhK) was initially characterized in Salmonella and subsequently characterized in E. coli where it was named PanZ (Stuecker, 2012a; Stuecker, 2012b; Nozaki, 2012). In EcoGene, panM is used as the primary gene name (gene symbol) and panZ is a synonym (alternate gene symbol) so that E. coli and Salmonella orthologs will have the same gene name when possible, continuing a genetic map tradition (Bachmann, 1990; Rudd, 2000). In Salmonella, and presuambly E. coli, PanM is a degenerate GNAT family homolog that lacks acetyltransferase activity due to a missing catalytic glutamate; PanM retains the ability to bind acetyl-CoA, which is required for its PanD co-activator function (Stuecker, 2012a; Stuecker, 2012b). PanM is the first functionally characterized member of the GNAT aceytyltransferase-related Pfam PF12568 (DUF3749) family (Finn, 2014).

FtsY binds ribosomes in a SRP (Ffh+Ffs) particle- and GTP-dependent manner, releasing trigger factor (Tig) from the ribosome (Buskiewicz, 2004). FtsY is found as both membrane-associated isoforms and as shorter soluble isoforms which are lacking the N-terminal 14 aa; FtsY is attached to the cytoplasmic membrane by its association with the secYEG translocon and the FtsY N-terminal 14 aa cleavable membrane anchor facilitates this association by first transiently anchoring FtsY to the membrane (Luirink, 1994; Weiche, 2008).

The associations or roles, if any, that YhiI and YhhJ might have in RbbA function is unknown, but it is possible that YhiI-RbbA-YhhJ is or was an exporter. YadH, YbhR, YbhS, YhhJ, and the RbbA C-terminal domain are paralogous ABC2-membrane permease family members (pfam01061/COG0842). The yhiI-rbbA-yhhJ operon promoter region binds ArcA and ArcA activates yhiI-rbbA-yhhJ operon expression (Federowicz, 2014).

RbbA is homologous to fungi-specific translation elongation factor 3 (EF-3). Hygromycin B inhibits RbbA ATPase and releases RbbA from ribosomes. A truncated N-terminal 47 kDa form of RbbA (the tandem ATPase domain) was previously isolated and characterized as Protein W (Kiel, 1999). YadH, YbhR, YbhS, YhhJ, and the RbbA C-terminal domain are paralogous ABC2-membrane permease family members (pfam01061/COG0842). The yhiI-rbbA-yhhJ operon also encodes YhiI, a membrane fusion efflux protein (MFP) homolog, and the YhhJ ABC transporter permease homolog that is paralogous to the RbbA C-terminal permease domain. The associations or roles, if any, that YhiI and YhhJ might have in RbbA function is unknown, but it is possible that YhiI-RbbA-YhhJ is or was an exporter. RbbA and YhjD interact (Babu, 2011).

The associations or roles, if any, that YhiI and YhhJ might have in RbbA function is unknown, but it is possible that YhiI-RbbA-YhhJ is or was an exporter. The YhiI MFP was mistakenly predicted to be a periplasmic binding protein (noted as subfamily "v"), leading to the mis-classification of RbbA(YhiGH)-YhhJ-YhiI as a putative importer (Linton, 1998). Overexpression causes abnormal biofilm architecture. YhiI has a predicted 23 aa signal anchor. The yhiI-rbbA-yhhJ operon promoter region binds ArcA and ArcA activates yhiI-rbbA-yhhJ operon expression (Federowicz, 2014).

PitA is a phosphate:H+ symporter and can also accumulate arsenate (Rosenberg, 1977). pitA mutants are resistant to Zn(II) and accumulate reduced amount of zinc (Beard, 2000).

b3502	EG12236	arsB	arsenite/antimonite transporter	Transport; Drug/analog sensitivity	Arsenite pump, inner membrane; resistance to arsenate, arsenite, and antimonite	ArsB can function alone using PMF to drive transport, as is the case with the chromosomal ArsB, which lacks the ArsA ATPase; ArsB proteins can use ATP to drive efflux if ArsA is present. The chromosomal ArsB is listed in TCDB as one of two 3.4.A.1.1 proteins; the TC 3.4.A.1.1 ArsA protein is plasmid-derived. The correct TC class for the stand-alone E. coli chromsomal ArsB is 2.A.45 and the ArsB protein should probably be re-classified as TC 2.A.45.1.2. IT (Ion Transporter) superfamily (Prakash, 2003). ST(3) structural class based on hydropathy profile (Lolkema, 2003).

E. coli O157:H7 YhiS (Z4907) has no IS5 and has a frameshift near the C-terminus relative to K-12. the S. flexneri version (SF3539) has a similar C-terminus to the K-12 version. YhiS may have a novel fold without detectable homologs.

It is unlikely that the outer membrane lipoprotein Slp and the LuxR family putative transcriptional regulator DctR perform redundant molecular functions; one possible explanation for the apparent redundant protection against acid stress is that Slp is required for C4-dicarboxylate export and that either active export (Slp+) or represssed import (DctR+) of acidifying organic acids is sufficient for protection against toxic metabolites during acid stress.   Cloned Slp has been shown to incorporate tritiated palmitate and mature Slp production is sensitive to globomycin, indicting Slp is a lipoprotein (Alexander, 1994). Greater than 92% of the slp mRNA is monocistronic and it is not known if all of the downstream dctR expression is based on readthrough of the slp terminator or if dctR also has its own promoter (Alexander, 1994; Tucker, 2003). slp is part of the EvgAS regulon (Masuda, 2002). The first 18 aa of Slp are a type II signal peptide. HT_Cmplx43_Mem: DcrB+MoaB+OsmE+Slp+YajG+YraP.
b3507	EG11889	dctR	Putative LuxR family repressor for dicarboxylate transport	Null	Putative LuxR family repressor for C4-dicarboxylate transport	A dctR mutation reverses the succinate growth defect of an atp operon deletion resulting in a Suc+ growth phenotype; DctA overproduction also confers Suc+ to the atp deletion strain; cloned dctR complements the dctR mutant Suc+ phenotype restoring the Suc- phenotype conferred by the atp deletion; it was proposed that DctR(YhiF) is a repressor for the dctA gene and that yhiF be renamed as DctR (Boogerd, 1998). E. coli K-12 has other known and putative dicarboxylate transporters such as DcuAB, CitT and YbhI that were not tested for suppression of the Suc- phenotype, and DctR was not shown to be a dctA repressor, so DctR could be repressing a dicarboxylate transporter gene other than dctA. dctR and slp are in the AFI 12 gene acid fitness island and their roles in acids resistance are to counter the effects of organic acids in spent medium; a slp-dctR(yhiF) double mutant, but not either single mutant, loses protection against metabolites that are toxic at pH 2.5 including formate, succinate, and lactate, but not acetate; the double mutant phenotype can be complemented by a yhiF clone but complementation by a slp clone was not tested; this implies that Slp and DctR provide redundant protection; the protective role for DctR during the acid resistance response may be repression of one or more C4-dicarboxylate importers; a dctA mutant did not alter the slp-dctR phenotype, indicating that other C4-dicarboxylate importers in addition to or instead of DctA may be repressed by DctR (Mates, 2007). Overexpression of DctR causes filamentous biofilm formation (Tenorio, 2003). DctR is possibly involved in the regulation of type III secretion systems in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (Tatsuno, 2003). dctR is part of the EvgAS regulon (Masuda, 2002). Greater than 92% of the upstream slp mRNA is monocistronic and it is not known if all dctR expression is based on readthrough of the slp terminator or if dctR also has its own promoter (Alexander, 1994; Tucker, 2003).

Acid-inducible and important for acid survival. HdeA and HdeB are both involved in periplasmic protein solubilization at pH 3; HdeA is involved in periplasmic protein solubilization at pH 2 (Kern, 2006).

b3512	EG11544	gadE	gad regulon transcriptional activator	Regulator; Not classified	Transcriptional regulator of gadA and gadBC	The 750 bp region upstream of gadE is termed the Sensory Integration Region and contains sites needed for the regulation of three promoters (P1, -124; P2, -324/317; P3, -566) by activators YdeO, GadX, an a proposed unknown MnmE-dependent regulator, as well as controlling activation by GadE, GadW and EvgA; no Crp regulation or shorter transcripts were observed (Sayed, 2009). The ArrS sRNA is encoded on the complementary strand of the gadE 5' UTR and is GadE-regulated (Aiso, 2011). The presence of a novel putative sRNA ending at -750 was noted as data not shown (Sayed, 2009). GadE overexpression confers acid resistance. GadE is induced by YdeO overexpression. GadE is in the EvgAS regulon. GadE is a LuxR family regulator. GadE is possibly involved in the regulation of type III secretion systems in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7. Required for stationary phase-induced, pH 5.5 growth medium-induced, and EvgA-induced acid resistance. GadE and phosphorylated RcsB form a protein complex to regulate glutamate-, arginine- and lysine-dependent acid resistance (Krin, 2010).

The endogenous function of MdtEF is proposed to be protection from nitrosated indole that accumulates during anaerobic nitrate resiration; the decreased mdtEF mutant survival rate observed during anaerobic respiration of nitrate is eliminated with the deletion of tnaAB (indole synthesis) or when fumrate is used instead of nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor (Zhang, 2011). EvgAS regulon. ArcA regulon. The first 20 aa of MdtE are a type II signal peptide. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine inducible, via Crp (Hirakawa, 2006). Crp represses mdtEF (Nishino, 2008).

b3522	EG12248	yhjD	inner membrane putative BrbK family alternate lipid exporter	Null	Probable BrkB family lipid IVA exporter; suppressor of msbA and KDO essentiality; LPS transport inner membrane protein	Electron micrographs of yhjD mutants reveal envelope perturbations similar to lptBCFG mutants; YhjD binds LptB and core LPS; yhjD mutants accumulate intracellular lipid A precursors (Babu, 2011). A point mutation in yhjD confering an R134C substitution was isolated repeatedly as a suppressor of the lethal KDO null phenotype of a srlQ kdsD double mutant and shown to permit the deletion of msbA, suggesting the mutant can export toxic lipid IV-A accumulating in the KDO mutant (Mamat, 2008). RbbA and YhjD interact (Babu, 2011). YhjD is not related to RNase BN; the distant paralog yihY was previously misidentified as the rbn gene and the error persists in many databases. YihY and YhjD belong to the B. pertussis virulence factor BrkB family (PF03631), formerly known as the UPF0761 family, although they have not been shown to be virulence factor in E. coli (Fernandez, 1994).

The yhjE promoter region binds ArcA and ArcA represses yhjE expression (Federowicz, 2014).
b3524	EG12251	yhjG	putative inner membrane-anchored periplasmic AsmA family protein	Null	Putative inner membrane-anchored AsmA family protein; periplasmic; function unknown	Although no association of AsmA with the OM was detected, AsmA superfamily members YhjG and YicH (but not AsmA itself) were predicted to be beta-barrel proteins indicating that the inner membrane-anchored AsmA family proteins may also insert into the outer membrane, consistent with their putative role in OM protein assembly and OM maintenance (Zhai, 2009). SignalP and TMHMM indicate a single N-terminal transmembrane segment of YhjG may serve as a signal anchor.
b3525	EG12252	yhjH	cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, FlhDC-regulated	Null	Cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, FlhDC-regulated; impaired swimming; suppresses motility defect of hns mutants in multicopy	Overexpressed Salmonella typhimurium YhjH (STM3611) enhances motility, counteracts cellulose biosynthesis and the rdar phenotype, and mediates cyclic-di-GMP degradation (Simm, 2004). YhjH contains a cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase EAL domain. The increased motility of the hns suppressing E. coli yhjH clones is consistent with the model that low cyclic di-GMP favors motility over sessility. FlhDC flagellar regulon. YhjH and YdiV are single domain EAL proteins. yhjH mutants have reduced swimming motility, dependent on ycgR and yegE: a null ycgR mutation fully suppress the yhjH motility defect; a null yegE mutation partially suppresses yhjH; a null yedQ mutation barely suppresses yhjH; a null ydaM mutation does not suppress yhjH (Figure 3A) (Pesavento, 2008). yhjH mutants have reduced swimming motility but normal swarming due to a defect in the frequency of flagellar motor switching (Girgis, 2007). The motility defect of yhjH mutations is suppressed by multicopy yfgF and by mutations in ycgR, fliZ, yfiR, yegE, crfC(yjdA), and yjcZ (Girgis, 2007). YhjH appers to have PDE activity despite having a partially defective EAL domain (Sommerfeldt, 2009).
b3526	EG12253	kdgK	2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase	Enzyme; Degradation of small molecules: Carbon compounds	2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase; 2-keto-3-deoxygluconokinase	KDG is derived from pectin, a common plant heteropolysaccharide, although E. coli K-12 does not secrete pectinases or uptake pectin oligosaccharides and has only the core KDG regulon as compared to plant pathogens like Erwinia chrysanthemi, whose extracellular pectate lyases and intacellular oligogalacturonate lyase breaks pectin down mainly into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) monomers and to a lesser extent polygalacturonase-generated galacturonate; in E. coli K-12 galacturonate uptake and degradation is mediated by the ExuT permease and the UxaABC catabolic enzymes producing KDG, respectively, and DKI is imported by the KdgR-regulated KDG importer KdgT and catabolized to KDG by the KdgR-regulated KduID enyzymes, also producing KDG; KDG is converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by KdsK and Eda(KdsA) (Rodionov, 2004; Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, 1996). KdgK is elevated 3-5X during growth at 4C (enabled by Oleispira antarctica Cpn10/60 transgene). This reliable gene assignment of kdgK is based on DNA and protein sequence analysis consistent with the published map position and function, respectively, of KdgK (Sofia, 1994). HT_Cmplx44_Mem: GlpC+KdgK+YahK.
b3527	EG12254	yhjJ	putative periplasmic M16 family chaperone	Null	Predicted degenerate periplasmic zinc metalloendopeptidase; M16 protease family; possible chaperone protein	PqqL, PtrA and YhjJ belong to the M16 zinc metalloendopeptidase family. YhjJ has a single M16 protease two-domain module, with an N-terminal M16 domain (PF000675) and a structurally homologous inactive C-terminal M-16 domain (PF05193); the YhjJ N-terminal domain active site should be HXXEH but it is HXXPR, indicating that YhjJ probably has no protease activity, but it may have chaperone activity (K.E.R.).
b3528	EG20044	dctA	C4-dicarboxylic acid, orotate and citrate transporter	Transport; Transport of small molecules: Carbohydrates, organic acids, alcohols	C4-dicarboxylic acid, orotate and citrate transporter; 3-fluoromalate resistance, D-tartrate resistant; uptake of D-malate	Null
b3529	EG12256	yhjK	cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase	Null	Cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase associated with cellulose production; dual domain protein; defective cyclase domain	A yhjK mutant has increased biofilm formation indicative of an increase in intracellular c-di-GMP (Chen, 2011). Although YhjK activity has not yet been assayed in vitro, a yhjK mutant has an elevated level of c-di-GMP relative to a wildtype strain (Furukawa, 2012). YhjK is a dual domain cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase with a defective diguanylate cyclase central domain: the I-site (RxxD) is missing and the A-site is SGYDF in place of the GGDEF; YhjK has a C-terminal EAL domain, however the HAMP linker signaling domain was not detected (Sommerfeldt, 2009). YhjK has a HAMP signaling domain (162-232) and two transmembrane segments (12-32; 159-176) that anchor the cytoplasmic HAMP linker, EAL and defective GGDEF domains to the inner membrane. The HAMP linker signal transduction domain is detected using EBI's InterProScan (PF00672, E=5.3E-11) but produces only insignificant matches to HAMP linker profiles using NCBI's CD-Search (PF00672, E=0.15; cd06225, E=0.10); InterProScan also detects the HAMP linker domain as matching ProSite PS50885 at a slightly different location (180-236), as annotated in UniProtKB P37649. YhjK residues 33-158 probably constitute a periplasmic sensing (signal input) domain related to biofilm and cellulose production. yhjK may be the last gene in the defective yhjR-bcsQ'ZCABC-yhjK operon. The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12. BcsA and BcsB are predicted to bind c-di-GMP.

The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12. The first 23 aa of BcsC are predicted to be a type I signal peptide.
b3531	EG12258	bcsZ	endo-1,4-D-glucanase	Null	Endo-1,4-D-glucanase; breaks down carboxymethylcellulose; periplasmic cellulase	The bcsQ' domestication in-frame stop codon pseudogene defect in K-12 strain W3110 has been repaired, restoring cellulose production, colony morphology, biofilm architecture, and the divergent bcs operons' functions to a presumably wildtype status (Serra, 2013). The first 21 aa of BcsZ are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. Probable false positive lipoprotein prediction; a soluble periplasmic BcsZ protein is predicted. The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12.
b3532	EG12259	bcsB	regulator of cellulose synthase, cyclic di-GMP binding	Null	Cellulose synthase, regulatory subunit; binds cyclic-di-GMP; periplasmic, membrane-anchored	Inverted membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli cells overexpressing E. coli K-12 BcsA and BcsB can synthesize cellulose in the presence of c-di-GMP (Omadjela, 2013). Overproduction of BcsB enhances exopolysaccharide production, flocculation (cell aggregation) in liquid culture, and biofilm formation, possibly incuding cellulose production, which most K-12 strains cannot make because of a mutation in bcsQ (Nguyen, 2014). The bcsQ' domestication in-frame stop codon pseudogene defect in K-12 strain W3110 has been repaired, restoring cellulose production, colony morphology, biofilm architecture, and the divergent bcs operons' functions to a presumably wildtype status (Serra, 2013). The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12. BcsB has a predicted 25 aa type I signal peptide.
b3533	EG12260	bcsA	cellulose synthase, catalytic subunit	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Celullose synthase, catalytic subunit; inner membrane protein	Inverted membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli cells overexpressing E. coli K-12 BcsA and BcsB can synthesize cellulose in the presence of c-di-GMP (Omadjela, 2013). The bcsQ' domestication in-frame stop codon pseudogene defect in K-12 strain W3110 has been repaired, restoring cellulose production, colony morphology, biofilm architecture, and the divergent bcs operons' functions to a presumably wildtype status (Serra, 2013). BcsA has a C-terminal PilZ domain; the PilZ domain of YcgR has been implicated in cyclic-di-GMP binding. The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12.
b3534	EG12261	bcsQ	involved in cellulose production, minD superfamily (pseudogene)	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction; required for cellulose production	The bcsQ' domestication in-frame stop codon pseudogene defect in K-12 strain W3110 has been repaired, restoring cellulose production, colony morphology, biofilm architecture, and the divergent bcs operons' functions to a presumably wildtype status (Serra, 2013). The bcsQ'(yhjQ') stop codon 6 is translated as an X in the reconstructed protein sequence; other E. coli strains have a Leu codon at this position (K.E.R., 2001, unpublished results cited in UniProt P37655). A previously reported filamentous phenotype for a bcsQ(yhjQ) mutant in a K-12 C600 background (which conflicted with its pseudogene status) has been retested in K-12 strains C600 and MG1655 and no phenotype of knocking out the pseudogene was observed (Kim, 2002; Le Quere, 2009). BcsQ(YhjQ) is required for cellulose production in vivo and for localization of cellulose synthase to a cell pole; the function of BcsQ(YhjQ) was determined in a cellulose-producing E. coli strain 1094, which has an intact copy of bcsQ(yhjQ) (Le Quere, 2009). BcsQ(YhjQ) is a member of the ParA/Soj subfamily of the Mrp/MinD family of P-loop ATPases. The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12.

A yhjR mutant does not block cellulose synthesis in the cellulose producing strain E. coli 1094 (Le Quere, 2009). The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs operon function in E. coli K-12.

The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12.

Salmonella BcsG was erroneously predicted to be an endoglucanase based on a match to an unnannotated gene downstream of the Cellulomonas uda endoglucanase gene in Genbank M36503 (Solano, 2002). The presence of an in-frame stop codon mutation in the bcsQ' gene abolishes cellulose production and bcs divergent operon function in E. coli K-12.

E. coli does not normally use exogeneous heme, but heme can be utilized if a foreign OM heme receptor is expressed in E. coli; heme and dipeptides compete for the same binding site; MppA is an alternative heme periplasmic binding protein; MppA or DppA is required for the uptake of 5-aminolevulinic acid (Letoffe, 2006). After four hours of Zn(II) stress, DppA protein levels decreased (Easton, 2006).

b3547	EG12268	yhjX	pyruvate-inducible inner membrane protein, putative transporter	Putative transport; Drug/analog sensitivity	Putative MFS antiporter, pyruvate-inducible; inner membrane protein	YhjX is the only protein directly regulated by the pyruvate-sensing YpdAB two-component system: YpdB binds to the yhjX promoter region, YpdB overproduction increased yhjX expression 24-fold, and deletion of ypdABC prevented induction by the pyruvate in LB; the induction was restored by a ypdAB clone; YpdB overproduction indrectly increased yjiY expression 4-fold since yjiY has no YpdB binding site (Fried, 2013). yhjX expression increased 50-fold in a yehTU mutant, but yhjX is indirectly repressed since YehT does not bind the yhjX promoter region (Kraxenberger, 2012). YhjX has been experimentally shown to be an integral membrane protein (Daley, 2005; Fried, 2013). The YpdAB and YehTU two-component regulators are paralogous; these two systems may be interconnected since they both regulate yjiY, directly by YehTU and indirectly by YpdAB; although not noted by the authors, both sytems also regulate yhjX, indirectly by YehTU and directly by YpdAB; the putative transporter genes yhjX and yjiY are the only two genes significantly regulated by YpdAB and YehTU (Fried, 2013). Caveat: experiments using overproduction of response regulators may cause artifactual cross-talk regulation. YhjX is similar to OxlT from Oxalobacter formigenes and may be an oxalate-formate antiporter; alternatively YhjX may be involved with pyruvate transport. YhjX may function with frc and oxc to catabolize oxalate. Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). The yhjX promoter region binds ArcA (Federowicz, 2014).

The yiaD mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of yiaD in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). The first 20 aa of YiaD are a type II signal peptide.

b3554	EG12273	yiaF	barrier effect co-colonization resistance factor; DUF3053 family lipoprotein	Null	Barrier effect co-colonization resistance factor; DUF3053 family lipoprotein	Mice colonized with an MG1655 yiaF mutant strain are less able to resist co-colonization with pathogenic EAEC 55989, i.e. yiaF mutants exhibit a reduced barrier effect (Da Re, 2013). YiaF has been identified as a membrane-associated protein by 2D-MS, with a non-uniform membrane distribution, indicating both polar and septal bias (Lai, 2004). Interpretation of YiaF results in Lai et al. (2004) was complicated by use of a predicted start site at Met(-40). A null mutant has no obvious growth defect (Lai, 2004). Reported MS detection of a fragment from 19R-30E (stated as 50R-69E in Lai, 2004) may indicate the presence of an uncleaved precursor form in minicell membrane preparations. The first 25 aa of YiaF are predicted to be a type II signal peptide. HT_Cmplx47_Mem: MscS+YiaF.

YiaMNO is a TRAP family transporter for the monocarboxylate oxo-acid 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate (2,3-DKG), a spontaneous breakdown product of ascorbate, therefore it has been proposed that the YiaJ effector molecule is 2,3-DKG (Thomas, 2006).

Probable false positive lipoprotein prediction, Cys not conserved, four inner membrane TMs predicted. A yiaMNO deletion is reported to have alterations in the transition from exponential growth to the stationary phase, high-salt survival and biofilm formation (Plantinga, 2005). L-dehydroascorbate in the environment can be spontaneously hydrolyzed to form the YiaMNO substrate 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate. A yiaN (orfM) mutant is able to grow on dicarboxylates, indicating that YiaMNO is not involved in dicarboxylate transport (Davies, 1999).

L-dehydroascorbate in the environment can be spontaneously hydrolyzed to form the YiaMNO substrate 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate. A yiaMNO deletion is reported to have alterations in the transition from exponential growth to the stationary phase, high-salt survival and biofilm formation (Plantinga, 2005). The cleavage of first 24 aa, a type I signal peptide, was confirmed using MS (Thomas, 2006). A yiaN (orfM) mutant is able to grow on dicarboxylates, indicating that YiaMNO is not involved in dicarboxylate transport (Davies, 1999).

The LyxK 3-keto-L-gulonate kinase activity is probably involved in the utilization of 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate, which can be formed by the spontaneous hydrolysis of dehydroascorbate (Yew, 2002).

A mutation in sgbH(yiaQ) blocked catabolism of xylulose formed from exogenous lyxose, but complementation with a sgbU(yiaR) plasmid indicated this was a polar effect and that sgbH(yiaQ) is not required for the catabolism of xylulose formed from exogenous lyxose (Iba?ez, 2000).

In vitro L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase activity could not be demonstrated, suggesting either unstable enzyme or wrong substrate (Iba?ez, 2000; Yew, 2002). A mutation in sbgU, complemented by an sbgU clone, blocked catabolism of xylulose formed from exogenous lyxose (Iba?ez, 2000).

A mutation in sbgE(yiaS) did not block xylulose catabolism formed from exogenous lyxose because lyxose induces the ara operon and AraD and SgbE(YibS) are isofunctional; a clone of either araD or sgbE(yiaS) can correct the xylulose catabolism defect of a double mutant; if the real inducer of sbgE(yiaS) operon does not induce the ara operon, then SbgE(YiaS) function would be required under normal operon induction conditions (Iba?ez, 2000).

RhsA could be cross-linked to Kps proteins in a K5+ K-12 strain; an rhsA mutant has reduced K5 polysaccharide biosynthesis in K-12 K5+ strain (McNulty, 2006). RhsA has 28 core RHS repeats including several repeats with YD dipeptides (Feulner, 1990). RhsA is a predicted polymorphic toxin that has a C-terminal conserved Toxin 55 domain that is a predicted RNase toxin (Pfam PF15606) that might be an intercellular growth inhibition module in that it also occurs in secreted bacterial insecticidal toxins and intercellular signaling proteins; the downstream yibA gene is predicted to encode an immunity gene (Zhang, 2012).

LldD is probably a cytoplasmic protein that is tail-anchored to the inner membrane by a TMPred-predicted C-terminal transmembrane helix (score=1016; residues 331-351) which indicates that the C-terminal 45 residues are probably in the periplasm (K.E.R.).

Although it is not certain that a TS revertant of the streptomycin-dependent phenotype of a gltE mutant is also in the gltE gene, transductional mapping of a gltE revertant TS phenotype is consistent with, and more precise, than the 5% xylE linkage; however the observed 63% linkage of pyrE and gltE is at odds with a 25% linkage predicted for the 34 kb pyrE-trmL interval (Lapointe, 1975; K.E.R., 2013). The cysX gene downstream of cysE is the reverse complement of trmL and is probably not a real gene (Tei, 1990). otherPDB (H. influenzae): 1J85, 1MXI.

E. coli gpmM mutants do not have a growth defect on minimal medium with glucose but alternative carbon sources were not tested (Foster, 2010). Purified GpmA has 10-20 times higher specific actvity than GpmM (Fraser, 1999; Foster, 2010). Purified GpmM contains Mn(2+) (Fraser, 1999). GpmM has four-fold higher specific activity with Mn(2+) than Mg(2+); Co(2+) also stimulated activity (Foster, 2010). gpmM and gpmA are non-essential genes but phosphoglycerate mutase is an essential enzyme since a gpmA gpmM double mutation is lethal (Foster, 2010). The yibN-envC,gpmM,yibQ divergent operon promoter region binds FNR and envC-gpmM-yibQ expression is activated by FNR (Federowicz, 2014). HT_Cmplx25_Cyt: GpmA+GpmM.

EnvC is recruited to the septal ring (Bernhardt, 2004; Uehara, 2009). EnvC is needed for FtsZ ring formation at 42C (Ichimura, 2002). EnvC has weak in vitro endoproteolytic activity against beta-casein (Ichimura, 2002). The first 34 aa of EnvC are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. EnvZ is proteolytically processed and localized to the periplasm (Hara, 2000). EnvC apparently had murein hydrolytic activity in an in-gel assay with murein sacculi as substrate, although this is likely to have been due to contamination with AmiC (Bernhardt, 2004; Uehara, 2010). envZ mutants are sensitive to crystal violet.

b3688	EG11712	yidQ	DUF1375 family outer membrane protein	Null	Probable lipoprotein, function unknown; Cys conserved	yceK and yidQ are paralogs. The first 20 aa of YidQ are a predicted type II signal peptide.
b3689	EG11713	yidR	DUF3748 family protein	Null	DUF3748 family protein, function unknown	YidR has an N-terminal DUF3748 domain and a C-terminal COG4946 (TolB-like) domain. 14/132 YidR peptide masses from MS analysis are consistent with the use of this start codon, (Maillet, 2007). Although this longer version of YidR has experimental support, the ribosome binding site and conservation are not consistent with the choice of this start codon; an alternative start at ATG codon 11 is conserved and has a good RBS and could be the true start codon.
b3690	EG11714	cbrA	colicin M resistance protein; FAD-binding protein, putative oxidoreductase	Null	Colicin M resistance protein; FAD-binding protein, predicted polyisoprenoid oxidoreductase	CbrA overexpression increases resistance to colicin M (Cma) and osmotic shock while a cbrA mutant is more sensitive to colicin M; purified CbrA has non-covalently bound FAD; CbrA may modify the Colicin M substrate, the C55 polyisoprenyl-PP- 525 MurNAc(pentapeptide)-GlcNAc, rendering it resistant to cleavage by Colicin M but this could not be demonstrated in vitro probably due to the insoluble nature of isolated CbrA protein (Helbig, 2012). cbrA is in the creBC regulon and is induced by the AI-2 pheromone.

Although the PDB structure is derived from E. coli strain Shigella flexneri 2a str. 2457T, there are only three amino acid differences from the K-12 YibB; structural similarity to homeodomain proteins suggests a DNA-binding function for YidB (Osipiuk, 2006).

b3702	EG10235	dnaA	chromosomal replication initiator protein DnaA, DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator	Regulator; DNA - replication, repair, restriction/modification	DNA synthesis initiator and global transcription regulator; binds DNA at DnaA boxes, binds cardiolipin and other acidic phospholipids, binds ATP	DnaA-ATP is the active form; DnaA-ADP is inactive; switching between the two forms modulates initiation activity. Acidic phospholipids release bound ADP, reactivating DnaA by allowing ATP to rebind. Null mutations in seqA, yccV or rpoN suppress dna46(Ts). Increases in DnaA levels reduce Fis oriC primary binding thus allowing DnaA to bind, this may play a role in the dynamics of prereplication complexes. Collapsed replication forks (primarily within 10 map units of oriC) are a result of the level of initiation induced by elevated dnaA expression. Hda-ADP is the monomeric active form for promoting clamp-mediated DNA-ATP hydrolysis (Su'etsugu, 2008). 2/43 DnaA peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).

YidC depletion activates the Psp response. YidC is required for proper membrane insertion of AtpE and CyoA. YidC assists proper folding of membrane proteins and thus is a chaperone as well.
b3706	EG10997	mnmE	tRNA U34 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification GTPase	Enzyme; tRNA modification	GTPase required for 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification at tRNA U34	The GTPase activity of MnmE is essential for its modification function. MnmE is required or the cmnm(5) addition to tRNA-s(2)U34, forming (with subsequent or interdependent MnmG action) cmnm(5)s(2)U34-tRNA, an intermediate in mnm(5)s(2)U34-tRNA synthesis. Mutants are hypomodified for s(2)U34 in tRNA(Lys). The carboxymethylaminomethyl donor is unknown. The MnmE-modified base U34 in tRNA is the wobble base. mnmE has proposed to be epistatic to mnmG, preceding it in the pathway (Bregeon, 2001). Yim (2000) suggest that the MnmE and MnmG activities are interdependent, not sequential. MnmG(GidA) and MnmE form a heterotetrameric complex (Yim, 2006).

TnaA is a key enzyme in L-cysteine degradation. Alkali-inducible. Downregulated during cold-shock and in early exponential phase. Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). TnaA binds plasmid colE1 sRNA Rcd, which modulates TnaA activity to regulate growth inhibition by Rcd for plasmid stabilzation (Chant, 2007).

The physiological role of ChrR may be due to its quinone reductase activity. The chrR(yieF) mutant enzyme Y6 kills HeLa spinner cells. The yieE-chrR operon promoter region binds ArcA and ArcA represses yieE-chrR expression (Federowicz, 2014).
b3714	EG11724	adeP	adenine permease, high affinity; adenine:H+ symporter	Transport; Transport of small molecules: Nucleosides, purines, pyrimidines	Adenine permease, high affinity	A clone of adeP(purP) was isolated as a multicopy suppresssor of a lethal yjeE deficiency (Handford, 2009). adeP(purP) is in the PurR regulon (Marbach, 2012).

b3722	EG10115	bglF	fused beta-glucoside-specific PTS enzymes: IIA component/IIB component/IIC component	Enzyme; Transport of small molecules: Carbohydrates, organic acids, alcohols	PTS system EIIABC enzyme, beta-glucoside phosphotransferase; BglG kinase/dephosphorylase; membrane-bound protein; binds BglG	BglF is probably phosphorylated at His547 in the C-terminal EIIA domain by phospho-HPr (PtsH); His547 then transfers the phosphate to Cys24 in the N-terminal EIIB domain which then transfers the phosphate to BglG, inactivating it in the absence of the beta glucoside sugar, or to the sugar during transport. bglF is part of the cryptic bglGFBH operon. The bgl operon promoter is silenced by H-NS, represssed by Fis and activated by CRP-cAMP.
b3723	EG10116	bglG	transcriptional antiterminator of the bgl operon	Regulator; Degradation of small molecules: Carbon compounds	Transcription antiterminator for cryptic bglGFBH operon; RNA-binding protein; dimerization and activity modulated by phosphorylation state; binds kinase/dephosphorylase BglF	The non-phosphorylated BglG dimer binds to RNA and allows readthrough of transcription. BglG has an N-terminal RNA-binding domain followed by two PTS-regulation and dimerization (PRD) domains, PRD1 and PRD2, which contain the phosphorylated sites. BglG is activated by phospho-HPr(PtsH)-mediated phosphorylation and is deactivated by BglF-mediated phosphorylation at a second site; the inducing beta-glucoside sugar causes BglF to dephosphylate BglG at the second site, leading to cytoplasmic localization of BglG, BglG dimerization, and activation of BglG-mediated antitermination of the bgl operon (Amster-Choder, 1992; G?rke, 1999). BglG is homologus to LicT of B. subtilis.

GlmS synthesis is negatively feedback regulated by glucosamine-6-phosphate, and YhbJ(RapZ) enables degradation the GlmZ sRNA; unprocessed GlmZ upregulates glmS mRNA post-translationally by mediating an RNase E cleavage of the glmS mRNA (Kalamorz, 2007). The GlmY sRNA upregulates glmS post-transcriptionally (Urban, 2007). GlmS can be inactivated by various halomethyl and methyl ketone derivatives, of which bromomethyl ketone derivative is most effective because of its high binding affinity. Cys2 is an N-terminal nucleophile for GlmS.

b3741	EG10375	mnmG	5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification at tRNA U34	Enzyme; tRNA modification	5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification at tRNA U34	MnmG facilitates cmnm(5) addition to tRNA-s(2)U34, forming (with prior MnmE action) tRNA-cmnm(5)s(2)U34, an intermediate in mnm(5)s(2)U34 synthesis. mnmG function is based on genetic experiments showing that it is in the same pathway as mnmE and that mnmE is epistatic to mnmG. MnmG contains an essential FAD-binding site (Yim, 2006). The basis of the mnmG(GidA) glucose-inhibited division phenotype is unknown. The proposal that mnmG(gidA) and trmF are allelic is based on similar phenotypes and map positions (Bregeon, 2001). MnmG(GidA) may have additional functions in the modification of RNA or DNA. MnmG(GidA) and MnmE form a heterotetrameric complex (Yim, 2006). mnmG has a promoter for the mnmG-rsmG operon (K?lling, 1988; Ben��tez-P��ez).

AsnA and AsnB are redundant; an asparagine auxotrophy requires that both genes be mutated. AsnA uses ammonia as the nitrogen source. Residues 199-203 of zwf encode a NNWDN peptide involved in MazF(ChpA) toxicity that is likely converted to NNWNN by AsnA since an asnA deletion prevents NNWNN activity (Kolodkin-Gal, 2007).

ViaA contains a Von Willebrand Factor Type (VWA) domain with a MIDAS site probably mediating the protein-protein interaction with RavA. viaA is in an rpoS-regulated operon with ravA. viaA(yieM)utants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006). The kup-ravA,viaA divergent operon promoter region binds FNR and ravA-viaA operon expression is activated by FNR (Federowicz, 2014).

The activity and allosteric regulation of IlvA have been studied using purified enzymes in vitro (Grimminger, 1973; Calhoun, 1973; Koerner, 1975; Eisenstein, 1991; Eisenstein, 1994; Eisenstein, 1995; Chen, 2013). The Salmonella RidA(YjgF) is an enamine and imine deaminase required for the removal of the two unstable, toxic, tautomeric reactive intermediates, aminocrotonate and iminobutyrate, which are produced during the IlvA-mediated, PLP-dependent threonine dehydratase reaction; producing 2-ketobutyrate and releasing ammonia in a hydrolysis reaction that may require catalysis, due either to the low water environment or immediate toxicity in the cell; IlvA also dehydrates serine to yield pyruvate via analogous enamine/imine intermediates, also removed by RidA (Lambrecht, 2012). The N-terminal sequence of cloned and overproduced IlvA shows that the fMet is clipped, but the natural ilvA RBS was not used so it is not Verified, but the ATG start is reliable based on comparisons to Salmonella; 95% of the purified enzyme had its N-terminus blocked (Eisenstein, 1991).

The 5' and 3' ends of a putative esrE sRNA were mapped within the ubiJ(yigP) gene; the authors reported that the growth defect associated with a (ubiJ)yigP deletion could be complemented with a minimal esrE gene; the authors reported frameshifts do not disrupt the ability of an esrE clone to complement, indicating an RNA not protein product is responsible for the complementation, but this result was late refuted; the 3' end of esrE corresponds to the stop codon of yigP; there is no obvious Rho-independent terminator at the end of esrE (Chen, 2012).

b3849	EG11021	trkH	potassium transporter	Transport; Transport of small molecules: Cations	Major constitutive K+ uptake permease TrkAH; high-rate, low-affinity transport; K+-translocating subunit; binds TrkA to inner membrane	Although normally required for Trk activity, overproduction of TrkG or TrkH alone increases K+ transport in a trkA mutant strain (Buurman, 2004). SapD(TrkE) is required for TrkAH activity and stimulates TrkAG transport rate (Bossemeyer, 1989; Dosch, 1991; Harms, 2001). Trk-mediated transport is driven by proton motive force, but requires a high ATP concentration for maximal activity, presumably because ATP-binding is needed to activate SapD (Harms, 2001). Anaerobically, TrkAH is proposed to form a membrane supercomplex with the F0F1 ATPase and formate-hydrogen lyase (HycB-HycE-FdhF) responsible for hydrogen gas production and 2H+/K+ exchange; thiol groups are required for this activity (Trchounian, 2000). otherPDB (V. parahaemolyticus): 3PJZ (Cao, 2011). otherPDB(V.parahaemolyticus): 4J9U; 4J9V (Cao, 2013).

b3859	EG11831	srkA	Cpx stress response Thr/Ser protein kinase; MazF antagonist protein	Null	Stress response kinase A, MazF antagonist; Thr/Ser kinase involved in Cpx stress response; lethality reduction protein	SrkA(YihE) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that indirectly antagonizes the MazF endonuclease (it does not phosphorylate MazF), which is part of the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system implicated in stress-mediated programmed cell death and bacterial persistence (Dorsey-Oresto, 2013). srkA(yihE) is required for long-term cell survival and for the expression of surface appendages (Zheng, 2007). The SrkA(YihE) protein kinase may be involved in the regulation of the extracytoplasmic stress response in E. coli (Zheng, 2007). SrkA(YihE) was identified as a weakly expressed 39 kDa cytoplasmic protein in E. coli (Belin, 1994). The srkA(yihE) gene is involved in virulence of Shigella flexneri via its regulatory role of the gal operon during LPS synthesis; mutations in srkA(yihE) result in altered LPS structure (Edwards-Jones, 2004). SrkA(RdoA) is involved in relaying cpx-induced signals in Salmonella, where it was named rdoA (Suntharalingam, 2003). srkA(yihE) is in an operon with dsbA in E. coli, but not directly involved in disulfide bond formation (Belin, 1994). A transcript array in Shigella shows major changes in an srkA(yihE) deletion strain (Li, 2001). Mutations in srkA have a hyperlethality phenotype when cells are stressed; SrkA is a protein that reduces the lethal effects of stress (Han, 2010). Cpx regulon.

b3865	EG11203	yihA	cell division GTP-binding protein	Null	GTP-binding protein required for normal cell division; predicted GTPase; also binds GDP	YihA was reported to be an essential gene by Arigoni (1998), but Dassain (1999) made a viable null mutant that grows slowly and forms filaments. Filamentation phenotype is suppressed by overexpression of ftsQI, ftsA and ftsZ. Unlike the other 11 GTPases in E. coli, YihA is not universally conserved among bacteria. Der and YihA are paralogs, with YihA matching the C-terminal GTPase domain better than the N-terminal GTPase domain. 2/52 YihA(EngB) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).
b3866	EG11835	yihI	activator of Der GTPase	Null	Activator of Der GTPase; GAP (GTPase Activating Protein)-like protein; Der-YhiI complex	YihI stimulates Der GTPase, possibly acting as a negative regulator of 50S ribosome assembly and retarding early exponential growth (Hwang, 2010). yihI is negatively regulated by RpoS in stationary phase. Der and YihI form a complex, as does Der-delta200 (lacking the N-terminal 200 aa domain of Der) and YihI-delta45 (lacking the N-terminal 45 amino acids of YihI) (Kobayashi, 2009; Hwang, 2010). YihI belongs to the UPF0241 family. Purified YhiI forms a dimer (Hwang, 2010). Both Der GTP-binding domains must bind GTP for viability and ribosome-binding (Hwang, 2006; Bharat, 2006; Tomar, 2009) The YhiI stimulation of Der GTPase activity requires both Der Ser16 and Ser216, indicating both Der GTP-binding domain activities are required for Der GTPase activity (Hwang, 2010).

b3875	EG13374	ompL	outer membrane porin L; putative sulpholipid porin	Null	Outer membrane porin L; putative sulpholipid porin	OmpL forms pores in reconstituted proteoliposomes that allow the diffusion of small sugars such as glucose, galactose and arabinose, but not maltose, indicating a small pore size; cysteine, tetraglycine and reduced glutathione permeate through OmpL pores rapidly but arabinose is transported at one fifth the rate of OmpF-mediated diffusion suggesting that OmpL is not a sugar-specific channel (Dartigalongue, 2000). OmpL has been proposed to be a sulpholipid porin because it might be the last gene in the yih(squ) operon encoding the sulphoglycolysis pathway; an ompL mutant can still utilize sulphoquinovose (SQ) (Denger, 2014). The cysteine and glutathione transport through OmpL is consistent with sulphoquinovose or sulpholipid diffusion but the small pore size might not be consistent with sulpholipid diffusion; if OmpL is a sulphoquinovose (SQ) porin, it is not required for SQ utilization; alternatively sulpholipids may be imported through an unknown lipid importer. An ompL null mutation has been reported to suppress dsbA mutant phenotypes, exhibit mild DTT sensitivity, slow growth and be M13 resistant, but these findings have been subsequently refuted (Dartigalongue, 2000; Sardesai, 2003).
b3876	EG11841	yihO	putative sulphoquinovose importer	Putative transport; Not classified	Putative sulphoquinovose importer	yihO(squO) is one of two transporter genes in the yih(squ) divergent sulphoquinovose (SQ) catabolism operon; YihO(SquO) but not YihP(SquP) is predicted to be an SQ importer because a yihO(squO) mutant fails to grow on SQ as a sole carbon source but a yihP(squP) mutant can still grow on SQ (Denger, 2014). Yih0(SquO) is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS).
b3877	EG11842	yihP	putative 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulphonate exporter, membrane protein	Putative transport; Not classified	Putative 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulphonate exporter; membrane protein	yihP(squP) is one of two predicted transporter genes in the yih(squ) divergent sulphoquinovose (SQ) catabolism operon; YihO(SquO) but not YihP(SquP) is predicted to be an SQ importer because a yihO(squO) mutant fails to grow on SQ as a sole carbon source but a yihP(squP) mutant can still grow on SQ, so YihP(SquP) was proposed to excrete the 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulphonate endproduct of SQ catabolism (Denger, 2014). Alternatively, since the putative sulpholipid alpha-glucosidase YihQ(SquQ) is predicted to be a cytoplasmic enzyme, YihP(SquP) could be a sulpholipid importer. YihP(SquP) belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS).
b3878	EG11843	yihQ	putative sulpholipid alpha-glucosidase; alpha-glucosyl fluoride glucosidase	Enzyme; Not classified	Putative sulpholipid alpha-glucosidase; alpha-glucosyl fluoride glucosidase	YihQ(SquQ) is proposed to be a sulpholipid alpha-glucosidase enabling the utilization of the sulphoquinovose (SQ) headgroup found in ubiquitous plant sulpholipids (Denger, 2014). YihQ(SquQ) has hydrolysis activity against alpha-glucosyl fluoride. YihQ(SquQ) is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 31.
b3879	EG11844	yihR	putative sulphoquinovose mutarotase	Enzyme; Not classified	Putative sulphoquinovose mutarotase	YihR(SquR) has been proposed to be an epimerase allowing the utilization of sulphoquinovose (SQ) derivatives (Denger, 2014). YihR(SquR) is the prototypical member of the YihR family (NCBI CDD cd09022) of the mutarotase superfamily (NCBI CDD cd01081; Pfam PF01263).
b3880	EG11845	yihS	sulphoquinovose isomerase	Enzyme; Not classified	Sulphoquinovose isomerase, sulphoglycolysis pathway	YihS(SquS) is sulphoquinovose (SQ) isomerase, converting 6-deoxy-6-sulphoglucose (SQ) to 6-deoxy-6-sulphofructose (SF) as the first catabolic step of SQ utilization by a sulphoglycolysis pathway; a yihS(squS) mutant does not grow on SQ as sole carbon source (Denger, 2014). YihS has weak D-mannose isomerase in vitro (Itoh, 2008). YihS may be the weak D-mannose isomerase associated with D-lyxose isomerase activity, involved in lyxose catabolism, previously mapped as manC, and purified, however the oligomeric forms and amino acid compositions differ (Stevens, 1976; Stevens, 1981). Overproduction of YihS from the ASKA clone allows for growth on D-lyxose as the sole carbon source (Notebaart, 2014). The YihS(SquS) protein was overproduced using a pET vector to force translation initiation; although the protein sequence does not verify the start site, the start site prediction is very reliable and the protein sequencing confirms a prediction that the initial methionine is not clipped off (Itoh, 2008).

Purified YihU(SquU) reduces succinic semialdehyde to gamma-hydroxybutyrate in an NADH-dependent reaction and a yihU(squU) mutant is more sensitive to exogenous succinic semialdehyde (Saito, 2009).

b3884	EG11849	yihW	putative transcriptional regulator for sulphoquinovose utilization	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Putative transcriptional regulator for sulphoquinovose operon	YihW(SquW) is predicted to be a transcriptional repressor for the divergent yih(squ) sulphoquinovose (SQ) utilization operon, but alternatively YihW(SquW) could be a transcriptional activator stimulating expression when SQ is present (Denger, 2014). YihW(SquW) belongs to the DeoR family of transcriptional regulators. 9/68 YihW peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).

YihY(Rbn) has been shown to be an inner membrane protein that has six predicted TM regions with its C-terminus in the cytoplasm (Daley, 2005). YihY and YhjD belong to the B. pertussis virulence factor BrkB family (PF03631), formerly known as the UPF0761 family, although they have not been shown to be virulence factors in E. coli (Fernandez, 1994).

b3928	EG11878	zapB	FtsZ stabilizer, septal ring assembly factor, cell division stimulator	Null	FtsZ stabilizer, coiled-coil protein; septal ring assembly factor, stimulates cell division	Anchoring of the Ter macrodomain at mid-cell is mediated by MatP binding to ZapB (Esp��li, 2012). ZapB forms filaments and binds FtsZ, presumably helping to form the initial Z-ring at the septum; septal localization of ZapB requires either FtsZ or ZipA; zapB mutants are elongated and have delayed cell division. ZapA binds to and recruits ZapB to the inner face of the Z-ring (Galli, 2010). Although the ATG at codon 3 is the conserved start codon, the spacing to the RBS is better for this proposed start.

A CTG start codon five codons upstream of the current start has been proposed as an alternate start site, but lack of conservation suggests the current start is correct (Maillet, 2007).

FtsN is a single pass inner membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and has a C-terminal periplasmic SPOR domain facilitating binding to the septal ring (Gerding, 2009; Arends, 2010). FtsN has been shown by FRET to directly interact with itself, FtsW, FtsI and ZapA (Alexeeva, 2010). ZapA has been shown by FRET to directly interact with itself, FtsN, FtsZ and FtsI (Alexeeva, 2010).
b3934	EG10200	cytR	Anti-activator for CytR-CRP nucleoside utilization regulon	Regulator; Global regulatory functions	Anti-activator for nucleoside utilization regulon	CytR and CRP cooperate to regulate genes involved in nucleoside utiization; CytR binds DNA weakly by itself but CytR binding directly to CRP stabilizes CytR binding to DNA and blocks CRP-mediated activation although CRP remains bound to DNA; release of CytR by cytidine binding allows for re-activation of transcription by CRP-cAMP (Valentin-Hansen, 1996) The CytR-CRP complex is a dual regulation transcription factor complex that is able to activate some promoters rather than repress, depending on the DNA context (Rasmussen, 1996). cytR mutants show improved growth on uridine. Eight target genes (deoC, cdd, ppiA, tsx, nupC, nupG, udp, rpoH) and auto-regulation of cytR constitute the CytR regulon; a tenth gene encoding an inner membrane protein, ycdZ(nupT), is predicted to be regulated by CytR-CRP based on conserved CytR and CRP binding sites but there is no experimental evidence for either YcdZ function or regulation of ycdZ (Sernova, 2012).

The first 18 aa of YiiX are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. YebB, YiiX and YaeF belong to the permuted papain-like NlpC/P60 enzyme (PPNE) superfamily; re-analysis of the unpublished E. coli YiiX structure PDB 2IF6 finds a probable fatty acid, modeled as stearic acid, in the active site, suggesting that YiiX is an amidase cleaving the amide bond between a fatty acid and a peptide (or protein) (Anantharaman, 2003; Xu, 2011). PDB 2IF6 is derived from E. coli O157:H7 and differs from the K-12 version at four residues.

With AhpCF, KatG protects aerobic, phosphate-starved cells from oxidative damage. N-terminus is reportedly blocked (Triggs-Raine et al, 1988.) Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). KatG is a tellurite reductase (Calderon, 2006). Overexpression of YchF causes hydrogen peroxide hypersensitivity probably due to direct binding and inhibition of the catalase-peroxidase KatG by YchF, dependent on the ATPase activity of YchF and regulated by the YchF phosphorylation state at Ser16; ychF transcription is repressed by OxyR (Wenk, 2012).

b3961	EG10681	oxyR	oxidative and nitrosative stress transcriptional regulator	Regulator; Global regulatory functions	Oxidative and nitrosative stress transcriptional regulator	OxyR responds to hydrogen peroxide by forming a Cys109-Cys208 disulphide bond which activates OxyR to up-regulate transcription of the oxidative stress regulon and the oxyS sRNA; OxyS then regulates expression of additional genes (Tao, 1989; Storz, 1990; Christman, 1989; Altuvia, 1997; Zheng, 1998; Lee, 2004). Both oxidized and reduced OxyR negatively auto-represses its own transcription, hence OxyR is a dual mode transcriptional regulator (Christman, 1989; Tao, 1991). During anaerobic respiration OxyR is S-nitrosylated due to nitrosative stress, activating OxyR to up-regulate genes in a distinct regulon that protect against S-nitrosothiols (Hausladen, 1996; Seth, 2012). Glutathionylation of OxyR in response to redox signaling may activate a third distinct OxyR regulon (Kim, 2002). Transcription of the catalase inhibitor protein YchF mRNA is repressed by OxyR (Wenk, 2012).

b3965	EG11022	trmA	tRNA m(5)U54 methyltransferase, SAM-dependent; tmRNA m(5)U341 methyltransferase	Enzyme; tRNA modification	tRNA m(5)U54 methyltransferase, SAM-dependent; tmRNA m(5)U341 methyltransferase; RUMT	TrmA(RUMT) is a dual-specificity methyltransferase responsible for m(5)U54 modification in all tRNAs and for m(5)U341 modification in tmRNA (Zamir, 1964; Goodman, 1968; Goodman, 1970; Bj?rk, 1970; Bj?rk, 1975; Ny, 1980; Greenberg, 1980; Sprinzl, 1987; Ny, 1988; Gustafsson, 1991; Feldon, 1998; Ranaei-Siadat, 2013). The modifed ribonucleotide 5-methyluridine, referred to as ribothymidylic acid, was found to be universally present in bulk E. coli tRNA (Zamir, 1965). The position of ribothymidine at position 54 was established when the first E. coli tRNA was sequenced (Goodman, 1968). Ribothymidine was shown to be uridine modified by a methyltransferase using tritiated methionine as the in vivo methyl donor for labeling 5-methyluridine in E. coli tyrosyl tRNA (Goodman, 1970). The trmA mutation was identified, named, mapped and predicted to be the structural gene for tRNA m(5)U methyltransferase (Bj?rk, 1970; Bj?rk, 1975). The trmA gene was cloned and restriction mapped (Ny, 1980). The tRNA m(5)U54 modification is found in all sequenced E. coli tRNAs (Sprinzl, 1985; Sprinzl, 1987). The TrmA enzyme was first purified based upon its tRNA m(5)U54 methyltransferase activity (Greenberg, 1980). TrmA with a high tRNA m(5)U54 methyltransferase specific actvity was purified, characterized, N-terminally sequenced and found to co-purify with a heterogenous RNA fraction (Ny, 1988). The trmA gene and promoter region were sequenced and trmA gene expression was shown to be growth rate regulated at the level of transcription (Gustafsson, 1991). The m(5)U341 modification in tmRNA was identified and TrmA was predicted to be the responsible tmRNA modification enzyme because m(5)U341 is the tmRNA base corresponding to m(5)U54 in tRNAs (Feldon, 1998). A trmA mutant lacks the m(5)U341 modification in tmRNA (Ranaei-Siadat, 2013).
b3966	EG10126	btuB	vitamin B12/cobalamin outer membrane transporter	Membrane; Outer membrane constituents	Vitamin B12 outer membrane receptor; receptor for E colicins, phages BF23 and C1	BtuB translation is regulated by adenosylcobalamin binding directly to btuB mRNA which contains a vitamin B12-responsive riboswitch (Nou, 2000; Nahvi, 2002; Johnson, 2012). The btuB mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of btuB in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). btuB is a non-essential gene (Koster, 1991). btuB deletions in the Keio collection also disable the 5' end of the downstream essential murI gene due to an unusually large 56 bp gene overlap, explaining why the btuB Keio mutants are merodiploid (Aufr��re, 1986; Zhou, 2012).

b3980	EG11037	tufB	translation elongation factor EF-Tu 2	Factor; Proteins - translation and modification	Translation elongation factor EF-Tu 2; GTP-dependent binding of aa-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes; has intrinsic GTPase activity when bound to kirromycin; subunit of RNA phage Q beta replicase	EF-Tu is the most abundant protein in E. coli comprising 5-10% of total cellular protein, well in excess of translational requirements (Furano, 1975; Jacobson, 1976; Neidhardt, 1977; Miyajima, 1978; Pedersen, 1978; Young, 1981; van der Meide, 1983). The only amino acid difference between TufA and TufB is the last amino acid, G394 in TufA and S394 in TufB. EF-Tu lysines K38, K177, K249, K253, K295 and K314 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011). EF-Tu lysines K177, K188, K209 and K314 can be modified to N6-acetyllysine (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2009). HipA binds and was reported to phosphorylate EF-Tu residue Thr-383 in vitro (Schumacher, 2009). HipA is not EF-Tu kinase (Germain, 2013). The phage P1 toxin Doc phosphorylates EF-Tu in vitro at Thr383, blocking its ability to bind aminoacylated tRNAs (Castro-Roa, 2013). EF-Tu can be modified at K57 to either N6-monomethyllysine or N6,N6-dimethyllysine; the methyltransferases responsible for these modifications are unknown (L'Italien, 1979; G.F.-L. Ames, 1979). Methylation of EF-Tu at K57 impedes GTP hydrolysis in vitro (Van Noort, 1986). Nutrient starvation promotes the conversion of N6-monomethyllysine to N6,N6-dimethyllysine at K57 in E. coli B EF-Tu (Young, 1990; Young, 1991). tufA encodes an essential function, with duplicate gene tufB, such that tufA or tufB can be deleted, but the double mutant is inviable. Coliphage Q beta replicase is comprised of the phage-encoded beta subunit and three bacterial proteins: TufB, Tsf and RpsA (Kondo, 1970; Kamen, 1970; Blumenthal, 1972; Wahba, 1974). RpsA is dispensible for RNA synthesis by coliphage Q beta replicase and is not part of the core replicase (Kamen, 1972; Hori, 1974; Landers, 1974). 50-80% of EF-Tu can be located at the cytoplasmic membrane, possibly as a result of nutrient stress, and EF-Tu may have a ribosome-independent role since it is present in at least a four-fold molar excess over ribosomes; methylation status of K57 may be related to membrane localization (Jacobson, 1976; Young, 1991). Various mutants and growth conditions have demonstrated that EF-Tu, or a precursor form pTu, can be localized to the outer membrane (Dombou, 1981; Lifson, 1986; Sedgwick, 1986). EF-Tu can form filamentous structures in vitro and has been suggested to be an actin-like cytoskeletal protein (Minkoff, 1975; Minkoff, 1976; Rosenbusch, 1976; Jacobson, 1976; Minkoff, 1977; Beck, 1978; Wurtz, 1978; Beck, 1979; Cremers, 1981; Schilstra, 1986; Helms, 1995; Helms, 1996; Norris, 2007). Although early results indicated a lack of an in vivo EF-Tu cytoskeletal structure in E. coli, subsequent experiments identified a helically organized EF-Tu-containing intracellular protofilament near the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane with polysomes attached; it was suggested that an EF-Tu-containing cytoskeletal web might be the original prokaryotic cytoskeleton and that MreB evolved later to build upon the EF-Tu cytoplasmic network and be a cell shape determinant (Schilstra, 1984; Mayer, 2003; Mayer, 2006). In B. subtilis, EF-Tu is found in a static helical structure at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane co-localized with MreB; MreB and EF-Tu interact in vivo and in vitro; reduction of intracellular EF-Tu affects cell shape but not translation efficiency; EF-Tu intracellular protofilaments may serve as tracks for dynamic MreB shape-determining filaments (Defeu, 2010).

The relC allele of rplK has a relaxed phenotype (Friesen, 1974; Parker, 1976). RplK has three residues trimethylated by the non-essential PrmA methyltransferase forming a blocking N-terminal N,N,N-trimethylalanine at residue A2 and forming two N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysines at residues K4 and K40 (Chang, 1975; Lederer, 1977; Dognin, 1980; Jerez, 1980; Vanet, 1994; Arnold, 1999). RplK lysines K72 and K81 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011). Probably due to the slow growth phenotype of rplK mutations, the rplK mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of rplK in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009).
b3984	EG10864	rplA	50S ribosomal subunit protein L1	Structural component; Ribosomal proteins - synthesis, modification	50S ribosomal subunit protein L1	RplA lysines K105, K154, K186 and K197 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011).

b3990	EG11590	thiH	tyrosine lyase, involved in thiamine-thiazole moiety synthesis	Enzyme; Biosynthesis of cofactors, carriers: Thiamine	Tyrosine lyase, involved in thiamine-thiazole moiety synthesis; complexes with ThiG; [4Fe-4S]-SAM cluster; Radical SAM superfamily	Anaerobically, glycine probably cannot be oxidized to form the probable thiamine biosynthetic intermediate dehydroglycine, so it is derived from tyrosine by the action of the tyrosine lyase ThiH; the products of the in vitro ThiH reaction are para-cresol and hydroglycine (Kriek, 2007). In E. coli B, para-cresol is probably converted to 4-hydroxy-benzoyl alcohol in vivo by an oxidase that is missing from K strains (Kriek, 2007), and thus 4-hydroxy-benzoyl alcohol is probably not the primary tyrosine cleavage product as previously suggested (White, 1979).

ThiG synthesizes the thiazole phosphate intermediate (4-methyl-5-beta-hydroxyethyl thiazole phosphate) in thiamine biosynthesis utilizing dehyrodglycine (derived from tyrosine by ThiH in the ThiGH complex), DXP (1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM/AdoMet) and the sulfur donor ThiFS thiocarboxylate (Kriek, 2007).

b3994	EG11585	thiC	phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase	Enzyme; Biosynthesis of cofactors, carriers: Thiamine	Phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase, thiamine biosynthesis; requires SAM and a reduced 4Fe-4S cluster	E. coli thiC mutants are blocked in the conversion of AIR to HMP (Vander Horn, 1993). In vitro, overexpressed E. coli ThiC increases phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase activity although a cell extract is also required, probably to reduce the 4Fe-4S cluster (Lawhorn, 2004). E. coli ThiC contains a 4Fe-4S cluster that requires either IscA or SufA for proper assembly (Tan, 2009). In vitro, purified Salmonella thiC-encoded phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase produces HMP (4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine) from AIR (5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole) utilizing SAM and a labile 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster in a reaction reminiscent of Radical SAM family reactions although ThiC does not contain the Radical SAM Cys signature motif (Martinez-Gomez, 2008). An apbE mutant of Salmonella typhimurium is blocked for thiamine biosynthesis at the ThiC step (conversion of AIR to HMP) (Beck, 1998; Beck, 1999). HMP is also known as 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine and AIR is also known as 5-aminoimidazole ribotide. thiCEFSGH operon expression is controlled by a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) responsive riboswitch in the 5' UTR. The thiC riboswitch is the target for the antibiotic pyrithiamine. The transcription start point (tsp) of the thiCEFSGH operon has not been mapped.

The hemE mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of hemE in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). The merodiploid hemE duplication in the Keio mutants strains probably compensates for the lack of supplemental 5-aminolevulinic acid.

AllR(GclR) and IclR can bind to the same DNA sequence so IclR binds to the AllR(GclR) binding site at the gcl promoter but a deletion of IclR has no effect on gcl transcription, implying other factor(s) may be involved (Walker, 2006).

Induction of the cadAB operon under acidic conditions and in the presence of lysine neutralized the extracellular environment and enables production of CO(2); production of cadaverine and aminopropylcadaverine instead of putrescine and spermidine also resulted. cadAB operon induction also generated a proton motive force. Lack of cadBA operon induction results in an increase in speF-potE operon expression. CadA(LdcI) is required for full pathogenicity of Salmonella and Vibrio. CadA(LdcI) and RavA ATPase form a complex.

Cells deficient in GroES and GroEL lyse due to inability to produce cell walls as a result of the reduced level of DapA, the first enzyme in the DAP synthesis pathway (McLennan, 1998). Growth below 8C is impaired due to GroESL inactivation and can be rescued by transgenic Oleispira antarctica Cpn10/60. Overproduction of GroESL can suppress tig/dnaK synthetic lethality at 30 degrees C (Ferrer, 2003). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). GroS lysine K34 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011).

The groL mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of groL in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). Cells deficient in GroEL and GroES lyse due to inability to produce cell wall as a result of the reduced level of DapA, the first enzyme in the DAP synthesis pathway (McLennan, 1998). Growth below 8C is impaired due to GroESL inactivation and can be rescued by transgenic Oleispira antarctica Cpn10/60 (Ferrer, 2003). Overproduction of GroESL can suppress tig/dnaK synthetic lethality at 30 degrees C. GroL lysines K34, K51, K117, K277, K321 and K390 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011). GroL lysines K42, K117, K122, and K425 can be modified to N6-acetyllysine (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2009). The groSL promoter region binds FNR and groSL expression is repressed by FNR (Federowicz, 2014).

b4146	EG12473	epmB	EF-P-Lys34 lysylation protein; weak lysine 2,3-aminomutase	Enzyme; Protein modification	Required for lysylation of EF-P Lys34; weak lysine 2,3-aminomutase activity; required for EF-P-mediated translation of polyprolines	EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) are required to modify EF-P Lys34 by lysylation of the epsilon amino group; failure to modify EF-P with lysine results in a slow growth defect; EpmB(YjeK) may convert alpha-lysyl-EF-P to beta-lysyl-EF-P (Yanagisawa, 2010). Efficient translation of polyproline-containing proteins is the function of EF-P and requires the EpmAB-mediated lysine34 lysylation (Doerfel, 2012; Ude, 2012). A third and final EF-P post-translation modification enzyme EpmC(YfcM) is identified as EF-P-Lys34 hydroxylase; EpmC(YfcM) acts after beta-lysinylation of Lys34 by EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK); EpmC(YfcM) adds an oxygen atom to the C5 position of Lys34 and does not modify the added beta-lysine; YjeA and YjeK were renamed as EpmA and EpmB, respectively (Peil, 2012). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) were predicted to be responsible for the modification of EF-P Lys34 with spermidine, but Lys34 is actually modified with another lysine, not spermidine; epmB(yjeK) is in the efp genetic neighborhood in many strains and all genomes that have the conserved Lys34 in EF-P have epmB(yjeK) orthologs; EpmB(YjeK) is a lysine 2,3-aminomutase homolog (but in a different clade) (Bailly, 2010; Yanagisawa, 2010). EpmB(YjeK) is a homolog of Clostridium subterminale KamA and has weak lysine 2,3-aminomutase activity, but its specific activity is only 0.1% of that of KamA and produces a slightly different product, indicating this may not be a physiologically relevant activity in E. coli (Behshad, 2006). Radical SAM superfamily.
b4147	EG12099	efp	polyproline-specific translation elongation factor EF-P	Factor; Proteins - translation and modification	Polyproline-specific translation elongation factor EF-P	Lysine34-lysylated EF-P functions to unblock translation stalled at polyproline; the maximal stalling effect of polyproline is seen with three consecutive prolines, although Pro-Pro-Gly also blocked translation in the absence of EF-P (Doerfel, 2012; Ude, 2012). epmC(yfcM) mutants do not display the pleiotropic and slow-growth phenotypes observed for epmAB or efp mutants in either E. coli or Salmonella, suggesting that the EpmC-mediated modification of EF-P is is not required for the translation of polyproline-containing proteins, the function of EF-P requiring the EpmAB-mediated lysine34 lysylation (Bullwinkle, 2012). EF-P is present at one copy per ten ribosomes (An, 1980). efp has been reported to be an essential gene (Aoki, 1997) and to be a non-essential gene (Baba, 2006). The S. typhi efp gene is non-essential (Langridge, 2009). EF-P is homologous to eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-5A (Kyrpides, 1998). The previously reported function of EF-P to stimulate initial peptide bond formation has been recently challenged and appears not to be a critical function of EF-P (Ganoza, 2000; Blaha, 2009; Bullwinkle, 2012). The crystal structure of EF-P from T. thermophilus (PDB:1UEB) shows that, like other translation factors, EF-P is a tRNA mimic (Hanawa-Suetsugu, 2004). The T. thermophilus crystal structure of EF-P bound to ribosomes (PDB:3HUW) shows that the tRNA-like EF-P does not bind to tRNA binding sites in the ribosome, but rather binds between the P-site and the E-site, although footprinting experiments had previously shown binding to the A-site (Aoki, 2008; Blaha, 2009). EF-P appears to assist in the proper positioning of the fMet-tRNA for the formation of the first peptide bond (Aoki, 2008; Blaha, 2009). An earlier report that EF-P Lys34 is modified with spermidine has been refuted; the Lys34 is modified with lysine (Aoki, 2008 ; Yanagisawa, 2010). A Lys reside in eucaryotic eIF5A homologous to EF-P Lys34 is modified with hypusine (Chen, 1997). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) are required to modify EF-P Lys34 by lysylation of the epsilon amino group; failure to modify EF-P with lysine results in a slow growth defect; EpmB(YjeK) may convert alpha-lysyl-EF-P to beta-lysyl-EF-P (Yanagisawa, 2010). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) were predicted to be responsible for the modification of EF-P-Lys34 with spermidine, but Lys34 is actually modified with another lysine, not spermidine; epmB(yjeK) is in the efp genetic neighborhood in many strains and all genomes that have the conserved Lys34 in EF-P have epmB(yjeK) orthologs; EpmB(YjeK) is a lysine 2,3-aminomutase homolog (but in a different clade) (Bailly, 2010; Yanagisawa, 2010). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). A third and final EF-P post-translation modification enzyme EpmC(YfcM) is identified as EF-P-Lys34 hydroxylase; EpmC(YfcM) acts after beta-lysinylation of Lys34 by EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK); EpmC(YfcM) adds an oxygen atom to the C5 position of Lys34 and does not modify the added beta-lysine; YjeA and YjeK were renamed as EpmA and EpmB, respectively (Peil, 2012).
b4148	EG11616	sugE	multidrug efflux system protein	Putative factor; Not classified	Multidrug efflux pump; overexpression resistance to cetylpyridinium	SugE was originally isolated as a multicopy suppressor, capable of suppressing the phage T4 growth defect of a groL mutant (Greener, 1993). sugE is not a multicopy suppressor of a groL mutant's poor growth at 43C, suggesting that sugE is not a generalized suppressor of groL defects (Chung, 2002). Unpublished results confirm that sugE is a multicopy suppressor of groL, but the tested phenotype of the groL mutant was not reported (Bay, 2007). SugE belongs to the SMR efflux pump family, DMT superfamily.

FrdAB and OmpW form a complex (Huang, 2006). HT_Cmplx15_Mem: FrdA+FrdB.
b4154	EG10330	frdA	anaerobic fumarate reductase catalytic and NAD/flavoprotein subunit	Enzyme; Energy metabolism, carbon: Anaerobic respiration	Fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit	Purified FrdAB has fumurate reductase activity and has low level succinate dehydrogenase activity (Dickie, 1979). FrdA was shown to be covalently modified with an FAD linked through the methyl group at position 8alpha to the N(3) of one of the FrdA histidine residues (Weiner, 1979). His45 was predicted to be the site of FrdA flavinylation with FAD by similarity to the sequenced histidine-modified bovine heart flavopeptide SHTVAAXGGIBLAAGBMDEBXWR (Kenney, 1972; Cole, 1982). Substitutions of FrdA at His45 still allow tight binding of FAD non-covalently but nonetheless still result in defective enzyme activities (Blaut, 1989). In vitro flavinylation of FrdA using crude extracts was stimulated by citrate, isocitrate, succinate and fumarate (Brandsch, 1989). The crystal structure shows that His45 of FrdA is covalently modified with FAD to form tele-8alpha-FAD histidine (Iverson, 1999). SdhE, the SdhA flavinylator, may also facilitate FrdA flavinylation (McNeil, 2013). The FrdA N-terminus is blocked so it could not be protein sequenced to verify the start; if the fMet is clipped then the Glu2 could form a blocking pyroglutamate, J. H. Weiner, personal communication cited in (Cole, 1982). frdA transcription is repressed by nitrate via the NarXL system. Repression is both direct by repressing promoter activity and indirect by repressing dcuS promoter activity. FrdAB and OmpW form a complex (Huang, 2006). HT_Cmplx15_Mem: FrdA+FrdB.
b4155	EG11211	epmA	Elongation Factor P Lys34 lysyltransferase	Enzyme; Protein modification	Elongation Factor P Lys34 lysyltransferase; required for EF-P-mediated translation of polyprolines	The pleiotropic phenotypes associated with epmA(poxA) mutations include synthesis of poxB, hypersensitivity to sulfometuron methyl, alpha-keto butyrate, and many amino acid analogs, slow growth rate, and hypersensitivity to many antibiotics and dyes; these phenotypes are likely due to impaired translation of polyproline-containing proteins, a function of EF-P that requires the EpmAB-mediated lysine34 lysylation (Doerfel, 2012; Ude, 2012). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) are required to modify EF-P Lys34 by lysylation of the epsilon amino group; failure to modify EF-P with lysine results in a slow growth defect; EpmB(YjeK) may convert alpha-lysyl-EF-P to beta-lysyl-EF-P (Yanagisawa, 2010). A third and final EF-P post-translation modification enzyme EpmC(YfcM) is identified as EF-P-Lys34 hydroxylase; EpmC(YfcM) acts after beta-lysinylation of Lys34 by EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK); EpmC(YfcM) adds an oxygen atom to the C5 position of Lys34 and does not modify the added beta-lysine; YjeA and YjeK were renamed as EpmA and EpmB, respectively (Peil, 2012).

The epmA(yjeA) pleiotropic phenotypes are not due to a defect in pyruvate oxidase and the apparent regulation of poxB may be a minor role for EpmA(YjeA). OtherPDB(S. typhimurium): 3G1Z.

Although YbdG also has miniconductance-type mechanosensitive channel activity, it is not expressed well, requires a mutation to observe gating in vitro, and thus its gene name has been changed back to ybdG. mscS, mscK(kefA), mscM(yjeP), ybiO, ybdG and ynaI are paralogs in the MscS family.

Queuosine (Q) is a hypermodified base found in the wobble positions of tRNA Asp, Asn, His, and Tyr. QueG(YjeS) protein expression is detected and it can be downregulated by an opposing DnaA-represssed transcript within the overlapping DnaA protein titration locus DatA (Kitagawa, 1996). QueG(YjeS) has an iron-sulfur center.

Nnr(YjeF) is responsible for the detoxification of hydrated NADH and NADPH; The C-terminal NnrD domain has the NAD(P)HX dehydratase activity and the N-terminal NAD(P)HX epimerase NnrE domain interconverts the R and S stereoisomers of NAD(P)H (Marbaix, 2011). The Nnr(YjeF) dehydratase has a two-fold higher catalytic efficiency with the (S)-NADPHX substate than the (S)-NADHX substrate (Marbaix, 2011). Insertions in nnr(yjeF) indicate this gene is non-essential. Nnr(YjeF) is homologous to B. subtilis YxkO which belongs to the UPF0031 family. otherPDB (B. subtilis): 1KYH. The unpublished crystal structure annotation (PDB id: 3RS8) for the Nnr(YjeF) ortholog from T. maritima also indicates Nnr(YjeF) has NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase activity, as uncovered using metabolite cocktail screening.

TsaBCDE are necessary and sufficient for tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification in vitro (Deutsch, 2012). Depletion of YjeE causes a proportion of cells to be enlarged, with a peripheral distribution of DNA; the YjeE depletion phenotype is suppressed by multicopy clones of rstA (Handford, 2009). YeaZ interacts with YjeE and YgjD, preferring YgjD (Handford, 2009). yjeE is non-essential in the presence of multicopy rstA (Campbell, 2007). Weak ATPase activity has been demonstrated in H. influenzae, but not E. coli. YjeE binding to ADP has been demonstrated in E. coli. otherPDB (H. influenzae): 1FL9, 1HTW. UPF0079 family.

In amiABC triple mutants, thickened dark bands termed septal peptidoglycan (SP) rings appear at division sites, representing a cell division structure that accumulates when septal synthesis and hydrolysis by the AmiABC amidases are uncoupled (Priyadarshini, 2007). A mutant lacking five murein hydrolases (amiABCmltCD=MHD90) has a delayed lysis phenotype after beta-lactam treatment (Heidrich, 2002). The first 22 aa of AmiB are predicted to be a type I signal peptide.
b4170	EG11281	mutL	methyl-directed mismatch repair protein	Enzyme; DNA - replication, repair, restriction/modification	Methyl-directed mismatch repair; matchmaker protein; weak DNA-stimulated ATPase	MutL DNA-binding is required for methyl-directed mismatch repair (Robertson, 2006). The ATPase activity of MutL is essential for mismatch repair (Ban, 1998; Ban, 1999; Spampinato, 2000; Robertson, 2006). MutL binds UvrD, stimulates UvrD unwinding activity and is required for UvrD loading onto DNA (Hall, 1998; Yamaguchi, 1998; Mechanic, 2000). MutL stimulates MutS and Vsr binding to mismatched DNA (Drotschmann, 1998). 6/82 MutL peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).

RNA binding is located primarily at the N-terminal. Although Hfq has been reported to have intrinsic ATPase activity, a subsequent study identifies the Hfq-associated ATPase activity as a heat-labile contaminant (Sukhodolets, 2003; Arluison, 2007; H?mmerle, 2012). Hfq has multiple regulatory roles including the destabilzation of ompA mRNA, improved rpoS translation, and as a co-factor for the DsrA sRNA DsrA.

HflX has both GTPase and ATPase activities (Jain, 2009; Dutta, 2009). HflX itself does not affect transposition efficiency and an earlier report of a defect may be due to a polar effect on hflKC (Twiss, 2005; Dutta, 2009).

Null hflC or hflK alleles stabilize cytoplasmic substrate cII. hflCK is a multicopy suppressor of ftsH htpX double mutant. HflC and HflK have periplasmic prohibitin homology (PHB) domains. The PHB domain is also called the SPFH domain, named after the proteins Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin and HflK/C (Tavernarakis, 1999; Morrow, 2005; Rivera-Milla, 2006; Browman, 2007).

Null hflC or hflK alleles stabilize cytoplasmic substrate cII. hflCK is a multicopy suppressor of ftsH htpX double mutant. Serine protease-like motif in HflC not required for cII degradation. HflC and HflK have periplasmic prohibitin homology (PHB) domains. The PHB domain is also called the SPFH domain, named after the proteins Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin and HflK/C (Tavernarakis, 1999; Morrow, 2005; Rivera-Milla, 2006; Browman, 2007).

b4179	EG11259	rnr	exoribonuclease R, RNase R	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Exoribonuclease R, RNase R	YbeY and RNase R work together to remove 33 nucleotides from the 3' end of rRNA and to degrade aberrant rRNAs; YbeY has in vitro RNase activity (Jacod, 2013). Four ribonucleases, Rnc, Rnr, Pnp and Rph, redundantly process 16S rRNA, and although this does not rule out a role for YbeY as co-ribonuclease with Rnr, the role of YbeY as being the nuclease activity responsible for the removal of the 33 nucleotides at the 3' end of 16S rRNA has been questioned (Sulthana, 2013). RNase R (Rnr) is de-stabilized by proteolysis in exponential phase relative to stationary phase due to Pka-mediated acetylation of Rnr Lys544 in exponential phase only; lysine-acetylated Rnr binds tmRNA-SmpB tightly for exponential phase Rnr protein degradation (Liang, 2010; Liang, 2011). Rnr is specifically required for SsrA-SmpB-dependent decay of non-stop aberrant mRNAs (Richards, 2006). The N-terminal cold shock domains are required for an intrinsic Rnr RNA unwinding (helicase) activity (Awano, 2009). The cold shock domains are dispensible for Rnr RNase activity on structured RNAs (Vincent, 2009). rnr is transiently induced after a cold shock. rnr is orthologous with Shigella virulence gene vacB.

YgiC and YjfC do not contain the CHAP amidase domain present in Gss. A mutant lacking ygiB, ygiC, yjfM, yjfC, and tolC has an exacerbated growth defect in mimimal medium and has increased antibiotic sensitivities relative to tolC-alone mutants; the phenotypic defects of the five gene deletion strain are complemented by a tolC plasmid; both the ygiBC and yjfMC deletions are needed to exacerbate the tolC phenotype indicating that YgiBC and YjfMC may have redundant functions; it is not known if all four genes need to be deleted to observe the tolC mutant phenotype exacerbations (Dhamdhere, 2010).

The C-terminal 100 aa domain of AidB preferentially binds its own promoter region in vitro and auto-represses in vivo (Rippa, 2010). AidB overexpression reduces nitrosoguanidine-induced alkylation mutagenesis (Landini, 1994). aidB is in the GadE regulon (Marbach, 2012). Ada regulon. aidB is induced by anaerobiosis and acetate, dependent on RpoS. AidB may bind DNA to protect it from alkylating agents; a substrate yielding a robust acyl dehydrogenase activity has yet to be found.

The constitutive promoter for UlaR has not been mapped, and a Northern blot of the ulaG mRNA has not been performed, but since induction of ulaG by ascorbate addition or ulaR mutation does not increase expression of a ulaR-lacZ fusion there probably is a transcription terminator preceding the UlaR promoter in the 107 bp ulaG-ulaR intergenic regiom; the ulaR promoter (RpoE class) with a +1 in the ulaG stop codon, predicted at RegulonDB, does not meet this criterion (Campos, 2002; Campos, 2004; Huerta, 2003). There is a potential Rho-independent terminator ending about 40 nt past ulaG (K.E.R.). UlaR has an N-terminal DeoR-like HTH DNA binding domain (PF08220) and a C-terminal DeoR-like inducer binding and dimerization sensor domain (PF00455), the latter domain family being derived from a catalytically inactive version of the ISOCOT fold (Anantharam, 2006). 
b4192	EG12492	ulaG	L-ascorbate 6-phosphate lactonase	Null	L-ascorbate-6-phosphate lactonase; involved in the utilization of L-ascorbate by anaerobic fermentation; phosphodiesterase activity	UlaG was predicted to be L-ascorbate-6-phosphate lactonase (Zhang, 2003). Purified UlaG has in vitro L-ascorbate-6-phosphate lactonase activity (Garces, 2010). UlaG has phosphodiesterase activity with model substrate bis-pNPP (Kuznetsova, 2005). An early pathway proposed for L-ascorbate catabolism did not include a predicted function for the divergent ulaG gene, depicting a spontaneous hydrolysis of L-ascorbate to 3-keto-L-gulonate outside the cell, but the authors also considered L-ascorbate import and phosphorylation via the PTS system followed by intracellular hydrolysis, as the pathway has since been shown to be (Yew, 2002). Spontaneous hydrolysis of L-ascorbate directly to 3-keto-L-gulonate is slow, but L-ascorbate metabolism in animals can proceed by nonenzymatic oxidation to dehydroascorbate, an unstable lactone that hydrolyzes spontaneously to 2,3-di-keto-l-gulonate (Zhang, 2003). 2,3-di-keto-l-gulonate is taken up directly by the YiaMNO TRAP transporter (Thomas, 2006). The divergent ulaG-ulaABCDEF operon is repressed by UlaR(YjfQ) looping and is induced by L-ascorbate in the medium, which is converted to the molecular inducer L-ascorbate-6-P during import by the PTS system (Campos, 2002; Zhang, 2003; Campos, 2004; Garces, 2008). The constitutive promoter for UlaR has not been mapped, and a Northern blot of the ulaG mRNA has not been performed, but since induction of ulaG by ascorbate addition or ulaR mutation does not increase expression of a ulaR-lacZ fusion there probably is a transcription terminator preceding the UlaR promoter in the 107 bp ulaG-ulaR intergenic regiom; the ulaR promoter (RpoE class) with a +1 in the ulaG stop codon, predicted at RegulonDB, does not meet this criterion (Campos, 2002; Campos, 2004; Huerta, 2003). There is a potential Rho-independent terminator ending about 40 nt past ulaG (K.E.R.).

YtfE can regenerate damaged AcnB and FumA in vitro (Justino, 2007). A ytfE mutant grows poorly under anaerobic respiratory conditions and has an increased sensitivity to iron starvation (Justino, 2006). The previously reported ytfE mutant strain has additional phenotypes due to secondary mutations resulting in the loss of 126 additional genes (Vine, 2010). ytfE is homologous to S. aureus scdA, which can complement a ytfE muation (Overton, 2008). ytfE expression is increased in fnr and fur mutants, but no obvious FNR or Fur binding sites were found.

The verified 21 aa signal peptide of TamA is consistent with an observed SecB-dependent precursor cleavage that is blocked by azide (Marani, 2006). Predicted tamAB-ytfP operon. yftM is added as a synonym because it is a common mispelling of ytfM.

Salmonella mgtA is regulated by a Mg(2+)-responsive riboswitch which attenuates transcription; the mgtA 5' UTR secondary structure is conserved in E. coli and the E. coli mgtA 5' UTR functions as a Mg(2+)-responsive riboswitch in a synthetic construct (Groisman, 2006; Cromie, 2006). In addition to the PhoP-regulated P1 promoter, there is a constitutive P2 promoter 83 nt upstream of P1 (Kato, 1999; Yamamoto, 2002; Minagawa, 2003). The mgtA riboswitch senses external Mg(2+) levels and, in addition to an attenuation mechanism, targets mgtA mRNA for degradation by RNase E at high external Mg(2+) levels (Spinelli, 2008). HAD superfamily: MgtA contains a putative phosphatase HAD domain at residues 367-662.
b4243	EG12524	ridA	enamine/imine deaminase, reaction intermediate detoxification	Null	Enamine/imine deaminase, reaction intermediate detoxification	The Salmonella RidA(YjgF) is an enamine and imine deaminase required for the removal of the two unstable, toxic, tautomeric reactive intermediates, aminocrotonate and iminobutyrate, which are produced during the IlvA-mediated, PLP-dependent threonine dehydratase reaction; producing 2-ketobutyrate and releasing ammonia in a hydrolysis reaction that may require catalysis, due either to the low water environment or immediate toxicity in the cell; IlvA also dehydrates serine to yield pyruvate via analogous enamine/imine intermediates, also removed by RidA (Lambrecht, 2012). The Salmonella RidA(YjgF) is required for full IlvE activity and for the dependence of the alternative pyrimidine biosynthesis (APB) pathway of thiamine biosynthesis upon the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (Schmitz, 2004). RidA(YjgF), RutC, TdcF, YoaB and YjgH are paralogs and members of a highly conserved RidA(YjgF) family (pfam:PF01042) with diverse mutant phenotypes; the family members form homotrimers, some binding 2-ketoglutarate or related compounds, and are probably all reactive intermediate deaminases. The rat homolog PSP (perchloric acid-soluble protein) has been reported to have endoribonuclease activity, Endoribonuclease L, against ss mRNA, inhibiting translation, but the E. coli homologsd are not RNases.

The region from leuX to yjhQ gene was once designated as prophage KpLE2 (Hayashi, 2001). Although this region contains several IS elements, it has no other phage gene homologs and has many core genes, and thus is unlikely to represent a prophage region; therefore all references to the KpLE2 prophage have been removed. The region clockwise from leuX through intB' has been designated as the PR-X prophage remnant and described as P2-like and highly deleted, although no length or right end was indicated (Casjens, 2003). PR-X has not been annotated as a defective prophage because it appears to be limited to one pseudogene, intB' and the leuX-intB' intergenic region.

b4319	EG10314	fimG	minor component of type 1 fimbriae	Structural component; Surface structures	Fimbrin type 1 minor component; fimbriae length; perhaps inhibits polymerization in type 1 fimbriae assembly	The crystal structure of the pilus elongation complex in which the tip complex assembly composed of FimC, FimF, FimG and FimH passes through the usher porin FimD has been determined (Geibel, 2013). FimG is one of 25 FimA homologs in E. coli K-12. fimG is induced during biofilm formation. The first 23 aa of FimG are predicted to be a type I signal peptide.

Mutants of FimH have been isolated that auto-aggregate (Schembri, 2001). FimH has a false positive lipoprotein prediction and has a verified 21 aa cleavable typeI signal peptide. Prototype of the FimH family.

b4327	EG12566	hypT	hypochlorite-responsive transcription factor	Regulator; Global regulatory functions	Hypochlorite-responsive transcription factor	Three HypT(YjiE) methionine residues are converted to methionine sulfoxides by HOCl, activating HypT as a transcription factor; MsrA and MsrB inactivate HypT (Dazic, 2013). hypT(yjiE) mutants are sensitive to HOCl and yjiE plasmids confer HOCl resistance (Gebendorfer, 2012). HypT(YjiE) is a global regulator responding to HOCl exposure that replenishes methionine and cysteine pools and down-regulates genes involved in iron acquisition (Gebendorfer, 2012). HypT(YjiE) forms a variety of oligomers including dimers, tetramers and hexamers (Gebendorfer, 2012). The identification of YjiE as a motility regulator has been challenged as subsequently no effects of HypT(YjiE) on motility were observed (Gebendorfer, 2012). HypT(YjiE) is a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. HypT(YjiE) was initially identified as a cell density-dependent motility repressor.

SdiA belongs to the SdiA-regulated family (PF06977) and may be distantly related to the "esterase-like activity of phytase" family domain (PF13449; CDD search E=0.01). YjiK has a predicted single transmembrane N-terminal membrane anchor. Although the PDB structure of the YjiK soluble domain is derived from CFT073, it only differs from the K-12 allele at three positions. SdiA regulon.

YjiT matches the first 488 aa of the 1099 aa Salmonella typhi YjiT ortholog STY4851. YjiT is homologous to the N-terminus of E. coli O157:H7 Z5897 (1117 aa).

McrB-S is seen in some overexpression constructs but has not yet been observed as a native protein. McrB-S has no known function.
b4347	EG12584	symE	toxic peptide regulated by antisense sRNA symR	Null	Toxic peptide regulated by antisense sRNA symR, function unknown	SymE is toxic when overexpressed which leads to inhibition of protein synthesis and RNA degradation (Kawano, 2007). LexA regulon. Lon protease substrate. SymE is a distant homolog of antitoxin MazE (Kawano, 2007).

b4351	EG10612	mrr	methylated adenine and cytosine restriction protein	Enzyme; DNA - replication, repair, restriction/modification	Restriction of DNA with certain methylated adenine or cytosine residues	9/98 Mrr peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed; 1/98 peptide masses indicate that occasionally the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). The N-terminus of overexpressed Mrr was determined, but the native RBS was not used and the initial Met was not clipped, probably due to Mrr protein overproduction (Waite-Rees, 1991). Mrr is normally cryptic, but is activated by high pressure stress, which leads to a recB-dependent SOS pathway activation.
b4352	EG10021	yjiA	metal-binding GTPase	Null	Metal-binding GTPase, function unknown; GTP-binding protein; may have role in zinc homeostasis	YjiA binds metals near its GTPase site, which may modulate its GTPase activity (Sydor, 2013). yjiA and yjiS are widely shared genes flanking the variable Immigration Control Region (ICR) restriction-modification cassettes of enterobacterial genomes (Sibley, 2004). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004).
b4353	EG12585	yjiX	DUF466 family protein	Null	DUF466 family protein, function unknown; may be involved with oligopeptide uptake	Paralogs cstA and yjiY are both in operons with paralogous small proteins of unknown function, ybdD and yjiX, respectively.
b4354	EG12586	yjiY	putative transporter	Orf; Not classified	Predicted transporter, function unknown; YehTU-regulated in stationary phase	yjiY is transcriptionally regulated by the YehTU two-component system; yjiY expression is absent in a yehTU mutant; the response regulator YehT binds the yjiY promoter as its only DNA target; yjiY is induced in stationary phase when cells are growing on amino acids or peptides (Kraxenberger, 2012). The YpdAB and YehTU two-component regulators are paralogous; these two systems may be interconnected since they both regulate yjiY, directly by YehTU and indirectly by YpdAB; although not noted by the authors, both sytems also regulate yhjX, indirectly by YehTU and directly by YpdAB; the putative transporter genes yhjX and yjiY are the only two genes significantly regulated by YpdAB and YehTU (Fried, 2013). Caveat: experiments using overproduction of response regulators may cause artifactual cross-talk regulation. A prediction that yjiY is oppE is based upon genetic mapping that places oppE in this region and the peptide utilization phenotype of its paralog cstA. Paralogs cstA and yjiY are both in operons with paralogous small proteins of unknown function, ybdD and yjiX, respectively. HT_Cmplx48_Mem: SecA+YdgA+YjiY.

Tsr functions as a warm receptor during thermotaxis.
b4356	EG12588	lgoT	putative L-galactonate:H+ symporter	Putative transport; Not classified	L-galactonate transporter; membrane protein	lgoT(yjjL) mutants fail to grow on L-galactonate and lgoT(yjjL) is upregulated during growth on L-galactonate (Reed, 2006). LgoT(YjjL) is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and is probably an L-galactonate:H+ symporter.
b4357	EG12589	lgoR	putative transcriptional activator for L-galactonate catabolism	Null	Transcriptional regulator for L-galactonate catabolism	lgoR(yjjM) mutants fail to grow on L-galactonate and lgoR(yjjM) is upregulated during growth on L-galactonate, indicating that LgoR(YjjM) is a probable positive transcriptional regulator for the lgo genes (Reed, 2006). lgoR(yjjM) and lgoD(yjjN) are probably regulated by ExuR (Suvorova, 2011). LgoR(YjjM) has an N-terminal GntR family putative DNA-binding domain (Pfam PF00392)) and a C-terminal probable inducer L-galactonate binding FCD domain (Pfam PF07729).
b4358	EG12590	lgoD	L-galactonate oxidoreductase; L-gulonate oxidoreductase	Enzyme; L-galactonate catabolism	L-galactonate oxidoreductase; L-galactonate catabolism; L-gulonate oxidoreductase; L-gulonate catabolism	Purified LgoD(YjjN) has both L-galactonate dehydrogenase and L-gulonate dehydrogenase activity in vitro (Kuivanen, 2014). lgoD(yjjN) is upregulated during growth on L-galactonate and lgoD(yjjN) mutants grow very poorly on L-galactonate (Reed, 2006). LgoR(YjjM) and LgoD(YjjN) are probably regulated by ExuR (Suvorova, 2011). LgoD(YjjN) is likely to be the L-galactonate oxidoreductase involved in L-galactonate catabolism described earlier (Cooper, 1979).

OpgB encodes two periplasmic phosphoglycerol transferases: the soluble periplasmic phosphoglycerol transferase II is cleaved away from the membrane-bound periplasmic phosphoglycerol transferase I (Lequette, 2008).
b4360	EG11214	yjjA	putative DUF2501 family periplasmic protein	Putative factor; Not classified	Predicted periplasmic DUF2501 protein, function unknown	The first 25 aa of YjjA are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. YjjA (P18) is expressed by readthrough from dnaTC promoter.

b4363	EG11215	yjjB	DUF3815 family inner membrane protein	Null	UPF0442 family protein, function unknown	Although a wildtype strain was unaffected, a yjjB deletion mutant exhibited 40% survival after one hour in 1 M NaCl (Kri Ko, 2014). The original yjjB sequence had a C-terminal frameshift extending YjjB, but homology analysis suggests that the extension is artifactual. No YjjB protein was expressed in minicells, but a LacZ fusion indicates this gene is expressed. Homology extends upstream to end of yjjP gene, but the predicted MW is a little higher than observed. A GTG alternate start at codon 3 has a better apparent RBS and would be coupled with the motif GTGA to the upstream gene stop codon. However the GTG start is not conserved in Salmonella and Yersinia, while the ATG start is conserved.
b4364	EG12592	yjjP	DUF1212 family inner membrane protein	Putative structure; Not classified	Inner membrane protein, DUF1212 family, function unknown; H-NS-repressed	Null
b4365	EG12593	yjjQ	putative transcriptional regulator	Putative regulator; Not classified	Putative transcriptional regulator, function unknown; H-NS-repressed, dimeric	yjjQ is the first gene in the yjjQ-bglJ operon but YjjQ and BglJ do not physically interact, and neither YjjQ overexpression nor a yjjQ deletion affects regulation of the bglBFGH operon (Venkatesh, 2010). A LexA-based two-hybrid test indicates that YjjQ forms homodimers (Venkatesh, 2010). Only clones including the most upstream bglJ ATG codon express functional BglJ (Venkatesh, 2010). A yjjQ deletion in E. coli APEC strain IMT5155 (O2:H5:K1) is virulence-defective, grows poorly in minimal medium, regulates various amino acid biosynthesis genes, and has reduced transcription of iron uptake genes (Li, 2008). An insertion in yjjQ confers increased sensitivity to methylglyoxal and dihydroxyacetone in a gloA mutant background (Kim, 2007). LuxR family.
b4366	EG12594	bglJ	bgl operon transcriptional activator	Regulator; Not classified	Transcriptional activator for the silent bgl operon; requires the bglJ4 allele to function; LuxR family	The bglJ4 mutation activates the silent bgl operon and allows arbutin and salicin transport and utilization.

b4374	EG12115	yjjG	dUMP phosphatase	Enzyme; Degradation of small molecules: Nucleotides	Noncanonical pyrimidine nucleotide house-cleaning phosphatase; dUMP phosphatase activity	Efficient in vitro substrates include: dUMP, UMP, and dTMP; phosphoramidase: in vitro activities demonstrated by Kuznetsova et al. (2005, 2006). yjjG mutants are sensitive to 5-fluoropyrimidine derivatives, such as 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (Titz, 2007). YjjG has a strict metal requirement for catalytic activity. Poorly utilized substrates include UDP, TDP and a variety of nucleotide monophosphates. A yjjG mutation blocks the utilization of thymine to feed a thyA auxotroph since it must first be converted to thymidine and dUMP dephosphorylated by YjjG is needed for that conversion (Weiss, 2006). YjjG is also called nucleoside 5'-monophosphate phosphohydrolase. HAD superfamily.
b4375	EG12114	prfC	peptide chain release factor RF-3	Factor; Proteins - translation and modification	Peptide chain release factor 3, RF-3; stimulates activity of RF-1 and RF-2	RF3 exits in two conformational states, state 1 which is a pre-translocation complex with a P-site tRNA and a pre-bound RF3 (inactive) while state 2 is a post-translocation conformation with RF3 tightly bound to the GTPase center and the tRNA at the exit site. RF-3 is a class 2 RF, and a G-protein. The very poor growth of rluD deletions in all E. coli K-12 strains is due to their having a mutant (or variant) prfB gene with Thr246 instead of the Ala246 or Ser246 found in other E. coli and Salmonella strains; rluD deletions have little effect on growth or stop codon recognition in a prfB Ala246 background (O'Connor, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD mutants in E. coli K-12 can be suppressed by point mutations in prfB or prfC (O'Connor, 2011).

YjjU and RssA(YchK) are distant homologs of the pfam01734 superfamily; RssA (COG1752 family) appears to be a core gene while YjjU (COG4667 family) appears to be a horizontal transfer. yjjU is in the CueR regulon (Marbach, 2012). yjjU is in the GadE regulon (Marbach, 2012).
b4378	EG12598	yjjV	putative DNase	Null	Predicted DNase, function unknown; tatD paralog but no Tat phenotype	6/33 YjjV peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007).

b4380	EG12171	yjjI	DUF3029 family protein, putative glycine radical enzyme	Putative enzyme; Not classified	Anaerobically-induced glycine radical superfamily enzyme; required for anaerobic growth	A yjjI mutant grows slowly on glucose anaerobically and does not grow on glycerol and nitrate anaerobically (Kang, 2005). yjjI is induced 5-fold during anaerobic growth in minimal glucose medium and yjjI induction is FNR-dependent, however yjjI does not appear to have an FNR box (Covert, 2004; Kang, 2005). YjjI and ortholog H. influenzae HI0521 were reported to be PflB homologs (Kolker, 2004). yjjI is in an operon with yjjW, which encodes a PflA-like radical SAM activase homolog that may bind and activate YjjI. YjjI is 40% identical to HI0521 (UniProt P44744) which matches a PFL family profile (Pfam PF02901). YjjI belongs to a superfamily of PFL-like glycine radical enzymes (NCBI cd00576; Superfamily SSF51998).

DeoC is a survival protein required for MazF-mediated survival of a small subpopulation after inhibition of translation (Amitai, 2009). Half of the native protein still retains the initial Met.

YtjB(Smp) is a member of the bacterial virulence factor haemolysin family (SMP_2; Pfam PF10144). YtjB has a predicted uncleavable signal anchor (residues 13-32) and probably is largely periplasmic; a predicted second transmembrane helix (residues 164-184) indicates that the C-terminal 29 residues of YtjB(Smp) may be in the cytoplasm. ytjB is transcribed divergently from serB from overlapping promoters. YtjB(smp) is homologous to ahpA of P. multocida, which induces anaerobic expression of the cryptic hemolysin HlyE(SheA) when cloned in E. coli

The N-terminal NadR domain encodes NMN adenylyltransferase that converts NMN to NAD. The central NadR domain encodes ribosylnicotinamide kinase which converts the PnuC substrate nicotinamide riboside (NR) to NMN as part of a proposed group translocation import process. The C-temrinal NadR domain encodes a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor regualting genes in the NadR regulon. pnuA alleles of Salmonella nadR are defective in MNM transport and utilization (Foster, 1979; Kinney, 1979; Foster, 1987; Foster, 1990).
b4391	EG12343	ettA	energy-dependent translational throttle A	Factor; Proteins - translation and modification	Energy-dependent translational throttle A; ABC-F family protein	EttA is an energy-dependent translational throttle that gates ribosome entry into the elongation cycle, sensitive to ATP/ADP ratio because the ATP-bound form of EttA binds to the ribosomal tRNA-exit site and restricts ribosomal and tRNA movements, inhibiting protein synthesis; EttA is a procaryotic ABC-F family member defined by two ABC transporter-related predicted ATP-binding domains (Pfam:PF0005) joined by a linker domain with a P-site tRNA-interaction motif (PtIM) (Pfam: PF12848); an ettA mutation impairs fitness in long-term stationary phase; other ABC-F family members include eucaryotic translation-related factors and the E. coli K-12 proteins Uup, YbiT, and YheS (Bo?l, 2014; Chen, 2014). Low abundance protein.

b4394	EG12600	yjjX	non-canonical purine NTP phosphatase, ITPase/XTPase	Null	Non-canonical purine NTP phosphatase, ITPase/XTPase; dimeric	ITP and XTP are products of oxidative damage and inhibitors of transcription and YjjX may be involved in detoxifying ITP and XTP, but the physiological significance and in vivo substrates for YjjX is uncertain (Zheng, 2005). The association of YjjX with Ef-Tu is of unknown physiological significance, since Ef-Tu is an abundant and sticky protein. YjjX is implicated in the detoxification of the thiamine metabolism inhibitors bacimethrin and CF3-HMP.
b4395	EG12164	ytjC	phosphatase	Enzyme; Not classified	Phosphatase, function unknown; multicopy suppressor of serB	ytjC is a multicopy suppressor of a serB mutation lacking phosphoserine phosphatase (Patrick, 2007). Although its natural substrate(s) is unknown, purified YtjC(GpmB) has phosphatase activity against the model substrates para-nitrophenyl phosphate and 6-phospho-benzisoxazole (Khersonsky, 2011). GpmB/PhoE/CobC family proteins (COG0406) are sometimes misannotated as predicted phosphoglycerate mutases instead of predicted phosphatases; B. subtilus PhoE (a broad-specificity phosphatase) and S. typhimurium CobC (ribazole-5'-phosphate phosphatase) are COG0406 members with known activities (O'Toole, 1994; Ridgen, 2001). YjtC(GpmB) is not a phosphoglycerate mutase. YtjC(GpmB) is a member of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, represented by the InterPro superfamily profile IPR013078 and CDD cl11399 (also called the dPGM superfamily) including phosphatases and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases as well as factor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases; the histidine phosphatase superfamily is characterized by a conserved histidine that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle (Fothergill-Gilmore, 1989; Fothergill-Gilmore, 1990; Jedrzejas, 2000; Johnsen, 2007; Rigden, 2008; Foster, 2010). His9 of YtjC is predicted to be the transient phosphohistidine by homology. C10/130 YtjC(GpmB) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007).

b4433	EG31147	sdsR	Null	Null	Stationary phase sRNA, mutS regulator	The sdsR(ryeB) sRNA negatively regulates mutS mRNA stability, revealing a probably RpoS-dependent mechanism of ampicillin-induced mutagenesis (Gutierrez, 2013). sdsR(ryeB) was initially characterized in Salmonella as a regulator of ompD and named sdsR; E. coli does not have ompD; although sdsR is abundant in stationary phase in E. coli and is probably regulated by RpoS, the RpoS-dependence of sdsR(ryeB) has not yet been shown in E. coli (Fr?hlich, 2012).
b4435	EG31150	isrC	Null	Null	Novel sRNA, function unknown, CP4-44; flu mRNA 5'UTR; putative prophage remnant	The 195 nt isrC sRNA is produced by premature termination of the 222 nt flu(agn43) mRNA 5' UTR; isrC may regulate csrD expression since isrC is complementary to csrD mRNA; the 3' end of isrC has been adjusted to match the 195 nt truncated flu(agn43) 5' UTR (Wallecha, 2014). The start site for isrC has been adjusted to match the precisely mapped start for the flu(agn43) mRNA (Waldron, 2002). isrC RNA was detected at a low level and predicted to be an sRNA (Chen, 2002). No function for the isrC sRNA has yet been experimentally determined and thus it is possible that isrC does not function as an sRNA and is just an attenuated 5' UTR for flu; iscR may be removed as a separate sRNA gene in the future.

The cyaR transcript apparently terminates at the PR-X attL (attP'B') site. cyaR may be produced by PR-X associated events and may function as an attachment site for P2-like prophages.

b4441	EG31155	glmY	Null	Null	sRNA activator of glmS mRNA, glmZ processing antagonist	YhbJ(RapZ) is an adaptor protein that recruits GlmZ to the catalytic domain of RNase E; GlmY is an anti-adaptor decoy sRNA that binds YhbJ(RapZ) competitively with GlmZ, protecting it from degradation (G?pel, 2013). GlmY facilitates a cleavage of the glmUS mRNA, upregulating GlmS synthesis, by antagonizing the probable YhbJ(RapZ)-dependent decay of the GlmZ antisense cleavage activator (Urban, 2008; Reichenbach, 2008). Increased GlmZ-Hfq leads to the cleavage of the glmUS mRNA at the glmU stop codon, upregulating GlmS synthesis; YhbJ(RapZ) negatively regulates glmZ (Kalamorz, 2007). A short form 148 nt GlmY(SroF) sRNA has 37 nt processed off the 3' end; the smaller GlmY predominates in rich medium, both are present in minimal medium (Vogel, 2003). RpoN regulon.

Overexpressed OmrA or OmrB sRNA negatively regulate OM proteins, e.g. CirA, FecA, FepA and OmpT. OmrB, and possibly OmrA, regulates gntP (Tjaden, 2006).

Overexpressed OmrA or OmrB sRNA negatively regulate OM proteins, e.g. CirA, FecA, FepA and OmpT. OmrB, and possibly OmrA, regulates gntP (Tjaden, 2006).

b4447	EG31160	sibD	Null	Null	Antisense sRNA regulator of toxic IbsD protein; in SIBd repeat	A revision of the MG1655 genome sequence revealed a missing 375 nt fragment, lost by recombination between the duplicate (90% identical) sibD and sibE sRNA genes, excising one sRNA gene copy and the 229 nt intervening sequence. Thus the previous name QUAD1 repeats is a misnomer, as there are really five copies of this repeat family in MG1655, and so it has been changed to SIB repeats (Fozo, 2008).
b4449	EG31162	psrO	Null	Null	Novel sRNA, function unknown	Null
b4450	EG31163	arcZ	Null	Null	sRNA positive antisense regulator of rpoS; binds Hfq	ArcZ is processed to a 55 nt mature active form (3' fragment) that binds Hfq and rpoS mRNA and positively regulates rpoS translation; an 88 nt 5' ArcZ fragment also accumulates in low amounts (Soper, 2010; Mandin, 2010). The function of arcZ was originally characterized in Salmonella and the tpx and sdaA targets (also regulated by ArcA) have not been verified in E. coli (Papenfort, 2009). Although the precursor RNA can be seen in low amounts, the predominant form of ArcZ is a processed 3' fragment of ~50 nt that accumulates in stationary phase cells (Argaman, 2001). In Salmonella, ArcZ processing is rne-dependent and the ~50 nt mature ArcZ can suppress tpx and sdaC (Papenfort, 2009).

Fusion thought to be for neighboring gene yhhX was really 5 nt down from the ryhB start of transcription, thus showing the Fur regulation of ryhB, not yhhX.

The hokA transcript is interrupted by IS150, interrupting and deleting part of the mokA and sokA regulatory genes.
b4456	EG31165	glmZ	Null	Null	sRNA antisense activator of glmS mRNA, Hfq-dependent	YhbJ(RapZ) is an adaptor protein that recruits GlmZ to the catalytic domain of RNase E; GlmY is an anti-adaptor decoy sRNA that binds YhbJ(RapZ) competitively with GlmZ, protecting it from degradation (G?pel, 2013). Increased GlmZ-Hfq leads to the cleavage of the glmUS mRNA at the glmU stop codon, upregulating GlmS synthesis; YhbJ(RapZ) negatively regulates glmZ (Kalamorz, 2007). The GlmY sRNA indirectly activates glmS mRNA by antagonizing the YhbJ(RapZ)-dependent GlmZ inactivating processing (Urban, 2007).

The role of YfjD in E. coli has not been determined. The predicted CTG start codon for yfjD has been confirmed by start codon mutagenesis (D. Dague and K.E. Rudd, unpublished).
b4462	EG13520	ygaQ	uncharacterized protein	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, has alpha-amylase-related domain; reported to be required for swarming phenotype	This is a hypothetical reconstruction of an E. coli K-12 pseudogene: three stop codons (111, 346, and 614) were marked with Xs to fuse 4 ORFs into YgaQ. The intact YgaQ can be found in E. coli O42 and S. flexneri 2a strains 2457T and 301; they have Trp codons at all three stop positions. E. coli O157:H7 has one in-frame stop in YgaQ.

b4465	EG12976	yggP	putative Zn-binding dehydrogenase	Null	Predicted Zn-binding dehydrogenase, function unknown	YggP has an N-terminal ADH-GroES-like domain (Pfam PF08240) and a central Zn-binding dehydrogenase domain (Pfam PF00107).
b4466	EG12994	sslE	putative secreted and surface-associated lipoprotein mucinase	Null	Putative secreted and surface-associated lipoprotein mucinase	SslE has been characterized in the extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli strain IHE3034 as a likely extracellular lipoprotein mucinase (UniProt D5D0J3); a sslE deletion strain lacks extracellular mucinase activity and this defect can be complemented by plasmid-encoded SslE but is not complemented by a cloned active site mutated SslE (Nesta, 2014). Purified SslE(YghJ) from EPEC strain H10407 degrades MUC2 and MUC3 intestinal mucins in vitro, and an active site mutation abrogates activity (Luo, 2014). SslE(YghJ) is secreted by the type II secretion system T2SS-beta, is localized on the cell surface of pathogenic E. coli cells, and is required for biofilm formation, colonization and virulence (Moriel, 2010; Baldi, 2013; Nesta, 2014). An sslE mutation has no effect on adherence and biofilm formation in an atypical EPEC strain (Hernandes, 2013). The non-pathogenic E. coli W strain secretes SslE (Decanio, 2013). Since K-12 lacks an intact T2SS-beta it is unlikely that K-12 secretes SslE. Although sslE(yghJ) is adjacent to the gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) genes, it is not required for Gsp-beta function, as determined for the ETEC strain H10407 which has an intact gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) operon (Strozen, 2012). SslE(YghJ) is homologous to V. cholerae accessory colonization factor AcfD. SslE(YghJ) has a central DUF4092 domain. SslE(YghJ) has an M60 zinc metallopeptidase-like C-terminal domain (Pfam PF13402) associated with mucinase activity (Nakjang, 2012). The first 23 aa of SslE(YghJ) are predicted to be a type II signal peptide and the N-terminus of SslE from the prototype human EPEC strain E2348/69 is blocked from Edman degradation (Baldi, 2012).
b4467	EG13291	glcF	glycolate oxidase 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster subunit	Enzyme; Central intermediary metabolism: Pool, multipurpose conversions	Glycolate oxidase 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster subunit	The GlcF subunit of glycolate oxidase has an N-terminal 4Fe-4S dicluster domain (pfam PF12838) with 8 conserved Cys residues; GlcF also has two C-terminal cysteine-rich domains (Pfam PF02754) each with invariant CCG motifs and two conserved single Cys residues. glcF and glpC are homologous horizontal transfer (HT) genes.

b4473	EG11604	smf	DNA recombination-mediator A family protein	Null	DNA recombination-mediator A family protein	Smf is homologous to the H. influenzae DNA protecting protein DprA and cloned Smf (E.c.) partially complements the transformation defect of a dprA (H.i.) mutant; a smf (E.c.) mutant had no transformation, Hfr-conjugation, recombination, or DNA repair defect (Smeets, 2006). Named smf because it is divergent to fms (def) gene. smf is predicted to have a CRP-S promoter co-regulated by both Crp and Sxy (Cameron, 2006). The RecQ domain protein Psyr_3804 from Pseudomonas syringae has been identified as a toxin with the Smf domain protein Psyr_3805 as the antitoxin, although there is no indication that the E. coli RecQ/Smf form a toxin-antitoxin pair (Sberro, 2013).

Van Shaftin, personal comm.) fusing yhfO and the old yhfP into one new ORF, renamed as frlC. The "C" at position 3500308 has been removed. The Genbank entry U00096 now also has this correction, and the previous ALT_INIT, so the frlC status is OK now.

b4486	EG12583	yjiV	pseudogene	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, helicase-like, C-terminal fragment	YjiV belongs to a helicase family of long proteins with unique C-terminal domains. A portion of this putative, reconstructed yjiV pseudogene was originally annotated as mcrD in Genbank X55662, and reported to inhibit McrE restriction (Raleigh, 1991, citing unpublished information). YjiV is homologous to Z5898 (2104 aa) from E. coli O157:H7, SPA4314 (2106 aa) from Salmonella paratyphi-a, and lpl2494 (2106) from Legionella pneumophila. The reconstructed YjiV pseudogene translation lacks the first ~400 aa, has a disabled stop at codon 45, is missing ~730 aa after residue 717, represented by an X at position 718, then is followed by the C-terminal 261 aa fragment. The Salmonella typhi YjiV ortholog appears to be frameshifted, forming two orfs: STY4849 and STY4850. The N-terminal deletion event also removed the C-terminus of YjiT.
b4487	EG14407	yjdP	putative periplasmic protein	Null	Predicted periplasmic protein, function unknown	The first 22 aa of YjdP are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. yjdP is annotated on the opposite strand of the now defunct phnQ.

b4488	EG10498	ilvG	pseudogene, acetolactate synthase 2 large subunit, valine-insensitive	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, acetolactate synthase 2 large subunit; valine-insensitive; acetohydroxy acid synthase II; heterotetrameric AHAS-II	A frameshift at codon 328, the defective ilvG allele present in MG1655 and other K-12 strains, has been hypothetically reconstructed and was probably acquired early during laboratory cultivation; the gene designation ilvO indicates a regulatory locus but ilvO mutations are actually alleles of the ilvG gene that correct or compensate for the original ilvG frameshift mutation (Favre, 1976; Baez, 1979; Smith, 1979; Subrahmanyam, 1980a; Berg, 1980; Lawther, 1981; Lawther, 1981; Gray, 1981; Lawther, 1982; Wek, 1987; Lopes, 1989; Burns, 1995; Parekh, 1997). The corresponding Salmonella IlvG N-terminus was Verified by protein sequencing, supporting this start site for E. coli (Schloss, 1985). The N-terminus of overexpressed E. coli IlvG was also sequenced, but the native RBS was not used. In E. coli strains with a functional ilvG, no ptsN phenotypes are seen, indicating that perhaps ptsN is not a real nitrogen source regulator (Reaves, 2011).

b4490	EG13860	efeU	ferrous iron permease (pseudogene)	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, ferrous iron permease; intact gene involved in iron uptake	The EfeUOB tripartite iron transporter is silent in E. coli k-12 due to a mutation in EfeU (Cao, 2007). A frameshift at position 36 was conceptually repaired, using the wildtype allele from Shigella sonnei Ss046 as a guide, the frameshifted codon (conceptually translated as X) probably encoded a Gly residue. An intact EfeU from E. coli strain Nissle 1917 was functionally characterized as an iron transporter in vivo and in vitro; efeUOB of K-12 are transcribed as an iron-depletion-inducible, Fur-dependent operon (McHugh, 2003; Grosse, 2006). FTR1 iron transporter family. CpxAR-regulon.
b4491	EG13889	ycgH	pseudogene	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction	ycgH has an in-frame stop codon at codon 507 and has a frameshift caused by a one basepair deletion in codon 859.
b4492	EG11307	ydbA	pseudogene, autotransporter homolog	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, autotransporter homolog; interrupted by IS2D and IS30C; reported to be required for swarming phenotype	Two independent insertions, IS30C and IS2D, interrupt ydbA. The IS2D insertion is in codon 839 and made a 5 bp target site duplication AACCC. The IS30C insertion is in codon 856 and made a 2 bp target site duplication CT. The pre-insertion YdbA sequence has been reconstructed and is consistent with the sequence of a closely-related E. coli 53638 protein with this region intact (NCBI gi 75515008). The first 21 aa of YdbA are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. The 17 codons between the two insertions encode PELTYADSGAKIVNKGT and were overlooked in previous reconstructions.
b4493	EG12103	gapC	pseudogene, GAP dehydrogenase	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, GAP dehydrogenase; glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase C	A stop codon at codon 39 is changed to a Lys; a frameshift at codon 249 was reconstructed. An intact 333 aa GapC protein is Z2304 from O157:H7.

b4496	EG14042	yedS	pseudogene, outer membrane protein homology	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, outer membrane protein homolog	Salmonella OmpS1 homolog. The first 21 aa of yedS are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. An in-frame stop was translated as an X at position 162; a frameshift reconstruction was made at codon 222.
b4497	EG13380	yeeL	pseudogene, glycosyltransferase homology	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, glycosyltransferase family	An intact YeeL is found in E. coli O157:H7 Z3137. Stop codon 235 is translated as an X in the reconstructed protein sequence. Intact alleles in other E. coli strains, e. g. O157:H7 Z3137, have a Gln codon at this position. Intact YeeL may be involved in the heptosylation of the adjacent adhesin homolog YeeJ, analogous to Aah of E. coli O126:H27.

Intact version present in other strains, including E. coli 06 (NCBI gi 26108868). ATG at codon -2 is not conserved.
b4499	EG11992	yehH	DUF4132 family pseudogene; defective yehI paralog	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, DUF4132 family domain protein; WGR-like domain-containing protein, LexA-regulated	yehH' appears to have an in-frame stop codon at position 275 and an apparent frameshift mutation at codon 950 that are hypothetically reconstructed. The yehI' b2115 ORF (molR') has been reported to be involved in molybdate metabolism (Lee, 1990). YehH' has an N-terminal WGR-like domain, as does YfeS; WGR domains are associated with eukaryotic poly-ADP ribosylation proteins (PARPs) and may be involved with DNA-activation; YehH' paralog YehI lacks an N-terminal WGR-like domain. Preceding the C-terminal DUF41332 domain shared with YehH, YehI and YehH also share the automatically-generated Pfam-B conserved domain PB000112. A Tn insertion in the yehH'(molR') gene is unable to reduce selenate to selenite (B��bien, 2002). The yehI' fragment ORF b2115 mRNA is transcribed and regulated by LexR and this predicted YehI' fragment may have retained a function in molybdate metabolism as evidenced by the ability to get mutant phenotypes (Lee, 1990; Fern��ndez de Henestrosa, 2000; B��bien, 2002). LexA regulon. YehI and YehH' are paralogs.
b4500	EG14081	yfaS	pseudogene, bacterial alpha2-macroglobulin YfaS variant family	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, bacterial alpha2-macroglobulin; YfaS variant family	Intact YfaS is a member of a variant family of bacterial alpha2-macroglobulins likely to be involved in protecting the bacteria from host defenses including proteases; the YfaS family appears to be horizontally acquired from mammalian host genomes and lacks the thioester motif CxEQ active in experimentally characterized E. coli K-12 MG1655 YfhM (ECAM) and found in other YfhM family members; the alpha-macroglobulin chicken ovostatin also lacks the thioester motif but can inhibit proteases without it; yfaS is in the yfaATSQP operon of predicted secreted proteins predicted to all be involved in defense against the host, possibly in the extracellular environment (Budd, 2004). YfaS' has an in-frame stop codon 1368 that is translated as an X in the reconstructed pseudogene protein sequence. The full length allele in many other E. coli strains (e.g. O157:H7 EDL933 Z3481 UniProtKB: Q8XE35) have a Trp codon in this position. E. coli may be able translate this stop codon with Trp at a very low level, producing some full length readthrough protein. The corresponding UniProtKB: P76464 sequence translates stop codon 1368 as a Trp. The first 38 aa of YfaS are predicted to be a type I signal peptide.
b4501	EG14411	torI	response regulator inhibitor for tor operon	Null	Inhibitor of TorR response regulator, CPS-53/KpLE1 exisionase; blocks torABC transcription	The response regulator inhibitor TorI belongs to a new family of atypical excisionases pfam PF05930 Phage_AlpA. Phage origin.

b4505	EG14418	insX	pseudogene, IS3 family transposase family	Null	Pseudogene, IS3 family transposase, ISX' in CP4-6 prophage; N-terminal fragment	InsX' is the N-terminus of an IS3 family transposase A encoded in the partial IS3-related ISX' element in the putative defective prophage CP4-6. InsX' matches 81 of the first 83 aa of Shigella flexneri ISEhe3-like 92 aa orfA transposase (UniProtKB: Q0T4M3). The ISEhe3 prototype in Pantoea agglomerans (GenBank: AF327445) encodes a 94 aa orfA transposase (UniProtKB: Q0T4M3) that is 90% identical (75/83 aa) to InsX'. The Q0T4M3 start codon corresponds to a GTG 2 codons upstream of the insX' ATG start codon. However this GTG does not have as good an RBS as the annotated insX' ATG start codon.

A ybdZ mutant has a growth defect under iron starvation (Felnagle, 2010). YbdZ can cross-activate heterologous amino acid adenylation enzymes, which should be co-expressed with their cognate MbtH-like facors in a ybdZ mutant host (Felnagle, 2010; Boll, 2011).

Putative transposase fragment.
b4515	EG14329	cydX	cytochrome d (bd-I) ubiquinol oxidase subunit X	Null	Cytochrome d (bd-I) ubiquinol oxidase subunit X; required for CydAB activity	CydX(YbgT) binds to CydAB and is required for full cytochrome bd-I activity in cells; overproduced CbdX(AppX) can substitute for CydX in vivo (Vanorsdel; 2013). CydX(YbgT) and CbdX(AppX) are in cytochrome oxidase operons and have conserved cysteines that might help coordinate heme groups, although substitution C14S was functional, belying this proposition (Sun, 2012; Vanorsdel; 2013). YbgT was expressed in minicells at high temperature as a ~4 kDa protein, with no evidence of type I signal cleavage (Muller, 1997). Overexpression causes abnormal biofilm architecture and reduced motility. A false positive predicted 23 aa signal peptide cleavage would leave a 14 aa mature protein. cbdX(appX) and cydX(ybgT) are homologs.

b4522	EG14463	ymiA	uncharacterized protein	Null	Predicted membrane protein, function unknown	An alternate start site 12 codons upstream is now predicted because an upstream YmiA peptide was detected using shotgun proteomics (Krug, 2013). The upstream start site has a poor RBS but some additional amino acid similarity while the internal site has a better RBS. YmiA has one predicted transmembrane helix, residues 31-53.
b4523	EG14351	yciX	uncharacterized protein	Null	Uncharacterized small protein	YciX has homologs in closely related species including Salmonella and Citrobacter. Residues 33-49 of YciX are predicted to be alpha-helical, constitute the most conserved segment of the protein, and have a weak (possibly spurious) hit (E = 0.02) to the PRK04307 profile using NCBI CD-Search; PRK04307 proteins belong to the DsbB superfamily of disulfide oxidoreductases, but the two YciX Cys residues are not conserved making it unlikely that YciX acts as a disulfide oxidoreductase.
b4524	EG13919	ycjV	pseudogene	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, malK paralog	An apparent frameshift at codon 321 has been hypothetically reconstructed. ycjV is part of the putative ycjM-V operon, which encodes a putative transport and catabolism system for an unknown sugar.

Predicted to be small GTPase family member. An example of an intact allele is SP: Q1RPC4.
b4539	EG14356	yoeB	toxin of the YoeB-YefM toxin-antitoxin system	Null	Toxin in the YefM-YoeB toxin/antitoxin pair; has in vitro RNase activity	YefM-YoeB is the only toxin/antoxin pair involved in Lon dependent lethality. Homologous to Enterococcus faecium Txe toxin.

ArnEF is also known as the probable 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose(Ara4N)-phosphoundecaprenol flippase. The arnBCADTEF operon promoter region binds FNR and arnBCADTEF expression is repressed by FNR (Federowicz, 2014).

b4550	EG11968	arfA	alternate ribosome-rescue factor A	Null	Alternative stalled-ribosome rescue factor A; binds 50S ribosomal subunits, synthetic lethal with ssrA; recruits RF-2	ArfA recruits release factor RF-2 to release tRNA from stalled ribosomes (Shimizu, 2012; Chadani, 2012). ArfA can rescue stalled ribosomes at the end of a non-stop mRNA without trans-translation (Chadani, 2010). arfB(yaeJ) is a multicopy suppressor of the synthetic lethality of ssrA and arfA (Chadani, 2011a). ArfA translation is regulated by SsrA: in the absence of SsrA a 55 aa truncated ArfA missing the last 18 aa is released from the ribosome and is functional in ribosome rescue (Chadani, 2011b; Garza-S��nchez, 2011). DUF331 family.

YrhC' is an N-terminal fragment and has an in-frame stop codon at codon 82 that is translated as an X but encodes Lys in YibA.
b4553	EG14400	ysaB	uncharacterized protein	Null	Possible lipoprotein, function unknown	The first 17 aa of YsaB are predicted to be a type II signal peptide, but there is no charged residue. YsaB is homologous to S. typhimurium STM3657 (SP Q8ZL94). EC-ST-only.

b4556	EG11708	glvG	pseudogene	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase; missing an internal gene fragment	The C-terminal 70 aa are found downstream and out-of-frame of the first 200 aa, missing about 170 aa internally (represented by an X in the protein sequence) as compared to GlvG (Z5177) of E. coli O157:H7.
b4557	EG11348	yidD	membrane protein insertion efficiency factor, UPF0161 family inner membrane protein	Membrane; Inner membrane	Membrane protein insertion efficiency factor, inner membrane protein	YidD has been localized to the inner membrane and shown to be required for optimal AtpE, CyoA and M13 P2 protein membrane insertion, which also require YidC (Yu, 2011). A small peptide corresponding to the translation of an ORF antisense to the rnpA-yidD overlap was detected in a shotgun MS experiment (Krug, 2013). UPF0161 family, DUF37 domain.

Toxin endoribonuclease MqsR degrades ghoS antitoxin mRNA but not ghoT toxin mRNA, amplifying the GhoT toxin production as a stress response (Wang, 2013). MqsR induction increases GhoT production; GhoT is localized to poles and does not cause cell lysis during normal physiology but does impair membrane function, causing a reduction of cellular ATP and PMF energy sources, a lowered metabolism, and an increase in the number of persistent (dormant) cells formed in the presence of antibiotics (Cheng, 2013).

b4572	EG13398	ylbE	NO-induced DUF1116 protein	Null	NO-induced DUF1116 family protein, function unknown	An apparent frameshift mutation at codon 85 was a DNA sequencing error in U00096.2 that has now been corrected in version U00096.3 (Freddolino, 2012; K.E. Rudd and G. Plunkett III, unpublished). ylbE has been shown to be NO-induced and ylbE mutants are reported to be slightly NO sensitive (Justino, 2005); YahG has a 50 aa N-terminal domain not found in YlbE.
b4573	EG11611	insZ	pseudogene, transposase homolog	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, IS4 transposase family, in ISZ'	Two frameshifts (at codons 62 and 111) and an internal deletion of about 150 codons have mutated this homolog of IS4 transposase InsG (442 aa). An internal 152 aa are present in InsG that are apparently deleted in InsZ' (they would be between positions 238 and 239 in the 299 aa hypothetically reconstructed discontinuous InsG' pseudogene protein sequence). This internal deletion also corresponds to residues 243-383 of the 445 aa IS4 transposase homolog VV1_2235 from Vibrio vulnificus (UniProtKB: Q8DAG), which is the closest homolog to InsZ'. InsG is the closest E. coli homolog. There are numerous pseudogene alleles of insZ' in other strains of E. coli, but no wild type insZ alleles have yet been found.
b4576	EG60053	insB6	pseudogene, IS1 transposase B	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	Pseudogene reconstruction, IS1 transposase B	An in-frame TAG stop at codon 98, normally encoding a Trp residue, has been translated as an X in this InsB6' pseudogene reconstruction; this reconstructed InsB6' has 16 amino acid differences relative to InsB1, InsB5, InsB8, and InsB9.

b4578	EG14359	insP	pseudogene, IS609 transposase A	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	Pseudogene reconstruction, IS609 transposase A	InsP' belongs to the COG1943/pfam01797 (Transposase_17) family. An in-frame stop codon at 1501382 (codon 96) is ignored to reconstruct this protein sequence; a conserved stop codon at the end of the gene has been mutated (TAG to CAG), so it is not translated in the reconstructed pseudogene protein sequence.
b4579	EG14236	yaiX	pseudogene, interrupted by IS2A; hexapeptide transferase superfamily	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, hexapeptide transferase superfamily; interrupted by IS2A	IS2A is inserted at codon 93 of the reconstructed yaiX' and creates a 5 bp target site duplication ATTAC. An intact allele of yaiX' is present in E. coli O6:K15:H31, strain 536 (UniProtKB: Q0TGD0). A close homolog can be found in E. coli 350C1 (UniProtKB: Q9ALL4). YaiX' is homologous to glucose-1-phosphate and other acyltransferases. YaiX' belongs to the hexapeptide transferase superfamily and has 6 hexapeptide repeats.

For the protein sequence reconstruction presented, an X is placed at codon 66, the site of a one bp deletion, and the protein sequence is continued in the new frame.
b4582	EG14308	yoeA	CP4-44 prophage; putative disrupted hemin or colicin receptor	Phage or Prophage Related	Pseudogene, frameshift, 3' deletion; CP4-44 putative defective prophage	yoeA' is interrupted by IS2F after codon 103; an intact YoeA allele is present in O157:H6 as Z3159, annotated as a 719 aa protein, but Met-5 is used as the start site because of a much better RBS, so this trucated frameshifted pseudogene represents the first 167 of 715 amino acids.
b4585	EG31175	chiX	Null	Null	sRNA regulator of OM chitoporin ChiP(YbfM); also an antisense regulator for CitA(DpiB)	ChiX(MicM) silences chiP(ybfM) mRNA, blocking translation and causing the chiPQ(ybfMN) mRNA to be degraded (Rasmussen, 2009). Upregulation of a chb operon-encoded trap-mRNA (the chbBC intergenic region acting as an anti-antisense RNA) causes degradation of the micM sRNA, leading to induction of chiP(ybfM) mRNA translation (Overgaard, 2009). ChiX(MicM) has been independently characterized in Salmonella, and the Salmonella name chiX is used for the E. coli sRNA as well (Figueroa-Bossi, 2009). ChiX(RybC,MicM) regulates citAB(dpiBA) mRNA; citAB(dpiBA) mRNA may be another ChiX trap-mRNA (also called an RNA decoy) as well (Mandin, 2009).
b4586	EG14451	ykfM	lethality reduction protein, putative inner membrane protein	Null	Lethality reduction protein, predicted membrane protein	Mutations in ykfM have a hyperlethality phenotype when cells are stressed; YkfM is a protein that reduces the lethal effects of stress (Han, 2010). YkfM has three transmembrane helicies predicted.
b4587	EG40014	insN	pseudogene, IS911 transposase A	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	Pseudogene reconstruction, fused IS911 transposase AB	The individual ORFA and ORFB proteins are also observed, but the fused ORFAB protein is the active transposase. Intact alleles of ORFAB include Q6Q6S9 and Q8GJ19. insN is interrupted by the insertion of IS30A at codon 86, also the site of translation frameshifting in the intact ORFAB. Two aminos acids are deleted at the insertion site (G87, Y88), represented by XX. The C-terminus is truncated at the site of ISY insertion, leaving 229 N-terminal residues. The annotated start site was verified for a wildtype IS911.
b4588	EG14355	ylcH	uncharacterized protein, DLP12 prophage	Phage or Prophage Related	Uncharacterized protein, DLP12 prophage	Immunoblots of chromosomal SPA-tagged YlcH failed to show a band, indicating that if ylcH is a gene, it is not expressed under the conditions tested (Hemm, 2008).

b4592	EG11114	cbdX	putative cytochrome bd-II oxidase subunit	Null	Probable subunit of cytochrome bd-II oxidase	CbdX(AppX,YccB) is a probable subunit of the cytochrome bd-II oxidase CbdAB(AppCB); CydX(YbgT) binds to CydAB and is required for full cytochrome bd-1 activity in cells; overproduced CbdX can substitute for CydX in vivo (Vanorsdel; 2013). cbdX(appX) and cydX(ybgT) are homologs.
b4593	EG14449	ymgI	uncharacterized protein	Null	Uncharacterized protein	ymgI and ymgJ are adjacent, divergently oriented, and similar to one another at their N- and C-termini (Hemm, 2008). It is possible that ymgI and ymgJ are not translated into proteins.

b4595	EG14393	yciY	uncharacterized protein	Null	Uncharacterized protein	YciY is present on a ~250 nt mRNA expressed in both rich and minimal media (Wassarman, 2001). YciY homologs are present in many enterobacterial genomes.
b4596	EG14460	yciZ	uncharacterized protein	Null	UPF0509 family protein	yciT(deoT) and yciZ(deoL) are co-transcribed and constitute an operon (Elgrably-Weiss, 2006). deoT stands for deoR-Type based on its homology to DeoR, and deoL stands for deoT leader peptide (Elgrably-Weiss, 2006). deo is reserved for genes involved in deoxyribose metabolism; deoT and deoL are designated as synonyms. There is no evidence that YciZ(DeoL) acts as a regulatory leader peptide. Supportive evidence for YciZ(DeoL) translation has been obtained using mass spectrometry analysis optimized for small protein detection (Muller, 2010).
b4597	EG31168	rydC	Null	Null	sRNA regulator of csgD and yejABEF	The sRNA rydC reduces expression of the biofilm and curli regulator CsgD (Bordeau, 2014). rydC regulates yejABEF expression; over-expression of rydC causes a thermosensitive growth phenotype on minimal glycerol, maltose, or ribose media (Antal, 2005). 
b4598	EG14394	yncL	stress-induced small inner membrane enterobacterial protein	Null	Small inner membrane stress-induced enterobacterial protein; function unknown	YncL is a stationary phase-induced small inner membrane heat shock protein of unknown function (Wassarman, 2001; Hemm; 2008: Alix, 2009; Hemm, 2010; Hobbs, 2011; Fontaine, 2011). The yncL-ydcXY divergent operon promoter region binds FNR (Federowicz, 2014). YncL orthologs are present in E. coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter genomes.
b4599	EG14395	yneM	inner membrane-associated protein	Null	Expressed protein, membrane-associated, function unknown; regulated by PhoPQ and Mg(2+)	The sRNA mgrR and the adjacent converging protein gene yneM are conserved and are also expressed in Salmonella (Sittka, 2008). The 5' end of the yneM mRNA was mapped (Moon, 2009).
b4600	EG13822	ydfJ	pseudogene, MFS transporter family; interrupted by Qin prophage	Phage or Prophage Related	Pseudogene reconstruction, MFS transporter family; possible K(+) transporter; interrupted by Qin prophage	The C-terminal portion of the interrupted ydfJ' pseudogene was expresed in mamallian cells and found to be a K(+) channel (Tang, 2011). The first 28 codons of ydfJ were separated by the insertion of 20,460 bp of the Qin prophage; 28 aa (translated from 1650862 to 1650779 bp) have been added back to the YdfJ protein sequence presented. An intact version is present in E. coli 536 (UniProtKB: Q0THP5). The insertion of Qin appears to have generated an 11 bp duplication GAAATCCATAA (1650768 to 1650778 bp) which may represent the Qin att site. Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS).
b4601	EG14462	ydgU	stationary phase-induced protein	Null	Stationary phase expressed protein, function unknown	Predicted TM segment.
b4602	EG14016	ynhF	stress response membrane 	Null	Stress response membrane protein, function unknown	YnhF has been identified as a chloroform-soluble peptide from the lipid fraction by partial peptide sequencing; YnhF retains its fMet initiator aa and is not deformylated (Guan, 2010). YnhF has a single predicted transmembrane helix and can be found in the mebrane fraction; YnhF is expressed during exponential and stationary growth (Hemm, 2008). YnhF expression is increased by partial oxygen depravation (Hemm, 2010). YnhF homologs can be found in some genomes of Citrobacter, Salmonella, Enterobacter, Cronobacter, Edwardsiella, Erwinia, Serratia, Pantoea, Pectobacterium, and Klebsiella species.
b4603	EG31170	rseX	Null	Null	sRNA regulating ompA and ompC translation, with Hfq	RseX was isolated as an rseP multi-copy suppressor due to its reduction of OmpC and OmpA.
b4606	EG14396	ypfM	stress-induced small enterobacterial protein	Null	Stress-induced enterobacterial small protein, function unknown	YncL is a stationary phase-induced small inner membrane heat shock protein of unknown function (Wassarman, 2001; Hemm; 2008; Hemm, 2010). ypfM was identified during a hunt for new sRNA genes because it displays a variable third position conservation pattern indicative of a coding region (Wassarman, 2001). YpfM orthologs are present in various enterobacterial genomes.
b4608	EG31178	ohsC	Null	Null	Antisense sRNA regulator of shoB toxin	The shoB mRNA is the now defunct RyfB sRNA.
b4609	EG31179	ryfD	Null	Null	Novel sRNA, function unknown	Null
b4611	EG31169	sibE	Null	Null	Antisense sRNA regulator of toxic IbsE protein; in SIBe repeat	A revision of the MG1655 genome sequence revealed a missing 375 nt fragment, lost by recombination between the duplicate (90% identical) sibD and sibE sRNA genes, excising one sRNA gene copy and the 229 nt intervening sequence. Thus the previous name QUAD1 repeats is a misnomer, as there are really five copies of this repeat family in MG1655, and so the name has been changed to SIB repeats (Fozo, 2008).
b4613	EG14431	dinQ	UV-inducible membrane toxin, DinQ-AgrB type I toxin-antitoxin system	Null	UV-inducible membrane toxin; DinQ-AgrB type I toxin-antitoxin system	DinQ is a 27 amino acid UV-inducible toxin that depolarizes the cell membrane, decreases ATP concentration, and affects nucleoid structure after UV exposure; DinQ and the agrB sRNA antitoxin constitute a novel type I-like toxin-antitoxin module that affects the cell response to UV-induced DNA damage; three lines of evidence demonstrate that the agrA sRNA antitoxin can neutralize the DinQ toxin: (1) an agrA deletion mutant is UV-sensitive, grows slowly, and is recessive, while the dinQ agrAB deletion strain is not UV-sensitive and grows normally (agrA single mutants have no phenotype, indicating that the agrA sRNA is inactive), (2) a clone with both agrA and dinQ does not display the UV-sensitivity caused by introducing a dinQ clone alone into wildtype cells, and (3) a dinQ clone cannot be introduced into an agrB mutant strain (Weel-Sneve, 2013). Immunoblots of chromosomal SPA-tagged DinQ failed to show a band, indicating that dinQ was not expressed under the conditions tested (Hemm, 2008; Hemm, 2010). LexA regulon. DinQ has a single predicted transmembrane helix.
b4614	EG31176	sokA	Null	Null	Pseudogene, antisense sRNA blocking mokA/hokA translation; the last 30/52 nt remain	Insertion of IS150 caused a 39 bp deletion relative to the intact hokA/sokA locus in E. coli C.
b4615	EG14438	yibV	pseudogene, putative cryptic Rhs immunity protein	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, predicted cryptic Rhs immunity protein; antitoxin in Rhs polymorphic toxin system	YibV' is a predicted cryptic antitoxin, or immunity protein (Pfam: PF15596), against an Rhs family polymorphic toxin. YibV' has been reconstructed, correcting a frameshift to match other E. coli strain alleles by removing an A after codon 109, producing a 145 aa protein sequence.
b4616	EG31167	istR	Null	Null	sRNAs IstR-1 and IstR-2, tisB regulators	IstR-1 (75 bp) is initiated from an internal promoter; lstR-2 is lexA-regulated, possibly mitigating the lstR-1 antisense inhibition of residual TisB translation during the SOS response (Vogel, 2004). The antisense sRNA IstR binds to and blocks an upstream ribosome loading standby site required for translation initiation of TisB; ribosomes probably slide to the highly structured downstream TIR after loading; this results in RNase III cleavage of the active, processed +42 tisB mRNA to form an inactive +106 tisB mRNA (Darfeuille, 2007).
b4618	EG14402	tisB	toxic membrane persister formation peptide, LexA-regulated	Null	Toxin involved in persister formation, LexA regulon; membrane peptide that decreases proton motive force and ATP levels; expression regulated by the divergent istR-1 sRNA antitoxin	TisB is required to form multidrug-resistant persister cells in response to treatment with ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that causes DNA damage (Dorr, 2010). A ~400 bp LexA-regulated mRNA covering tisB has been observed in Northern blots (De Henestrosa et al, 2000). lstR-1 mediates antisense inhibition of TisB translation and this inhibition may be mitigated during the SOS response by the the istR-2 sRNA which has a LexA-regulated promoter upstream of the IstR-1 promoter (Vogel, 2004). The antisense sRNA IstR-1 binds to and blocks an upstream ribosome loading standby site required for translation initiation of TisB; ribosomes probably slide to the highly structured downstream TIR after loading; this results in RNase III cleavage of the active, processed +42 tisB mRNA to form an inactive +106 tisB mRNA (Darfeuille, 2007). Overexpression of tisB mRNA inhibits the SOS response including UV sensitivity and a delayed induction of recA; TisB toxin is implicated by two internal sense-to-nonsense mutations that cause premature translation termination and abolish the SOS inhibition, however a start codon mutation with normal amounts of tisB RNA does not block the effect, indicating that the TisB toxin may not be the effector; the unprocessed tisB pre-mRNA functions as an antisense RNA regulator of uxaA, resulting in cleavage of uxaA mRNA at the antisense site and also reciprocal cleavage and activation of the tisB pre-mRNA (forming the +42 tisB RNA); the tisB pre-RNA probably regulates dinD translation also; the tisB SOS defect is dependent on the presence of the uxaA antisense target and the dinD putative antisense target (Weel-Sneve, 2008). Although plasmid mutations indicate TisB is expressible, chromosomal expression has not been detected. The internal stop codon TisB mutations may block the SOS inhibition by reducing the amount of tisB pre-RNA present (which was not measured) and that the pre-RNA antisense regulation is solely responsible for the SOS inhibition, possibly explaining the discrepancy between the SOS inhibition phenotypes of the start codon mutation and the internal stop mutations observed by Weel-Sneve, 2008. TisB is conserved in Salmonella, but the previously annotated protein TisA is not conserved; tisA is not translated. Mutating the TisB translation start site blocks the toxic effect (Vogel, 2004). Previously tisA(ysdA) and tisB(ysdB) were fused into one hypothetical ORF by frameshift reconstruction, but this region was resequenced by De Henestrosa et al, 2000, who confirm the sequence is correct, so two separate ORFs were reinstated, but tisA has now been removed as a dubious annotation.
b4620	EG14459	yjbT	putative periplasmic protein	Null	Predicted periplasmic protein, function unknown	The first 29 aa of YjbT are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. yjbT is restricted to E. coli genomes. The convergent yjbH_yjbT interval has a predicted Rho-independent bi-directional terminator.

b4623	EG40121	insO	pseudogene, IS911 transposase B	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	Pseudogene reconstruction, fused IS911 transposase AB	The individual ORFA and ORFB proteins are also observed, but the fused ORFAB protein is the active transposase. insO is interrupted by the insertion of IS30D at codon 86, also the site of translation frameshifting in the intact ORFAB. 43 aminos acids are deleted at the insertion site, represented by Xs. A frameshift mutation caused by a one base pair deletion in codon 285 was hypothetically corrected by translating codon 285 as X instead of the H that was probably there prior to the one base pair deletion event; frame is preserved in the gene reconstruction by repeating the nucleotide prior to the deleted nucleotide. The annotated start site was verified for a wildtype IS911. The last seven residues of ORFB are polymorphic; the C-terminal residues of this reconstructed ORFAB from K-12 matches the C-terminus of ORFB from UniProtKB M9F4Q3. Fused versions of ORFAB include UniProtKB Q6Q6S9 and Q8GJ19, but with different C-terminal residues than K-12.

b4625	EG31180	symR	Null	Null	sRNA destabilizing divergent and overlapping symE mRNA	symR(ryjC) was identified by sequencing size-selected sRNA-derived clones (Kawano, 2005). A symR -10 promoter mutation prevents chromsomal symR transcription, increasing symE mRNA three-fold and SymE protein seven-fold as does anti-SymR RNA expressed in trans (Kawano, 2007). Endogenous SymR sRNA is 10-fold higher than symE mRNA and 40-fold plasmid-based overexpression of SymR results in a loss of symE mRNA (Kawano, 2007).

Clark, pers. comm., 1998). The ends of Rac are marked at the left end of these repeat regions to delineate attB and attP. This Rac integration event is within the ttcA gene; the first 17 aa of TtcA are Rac-derived. The ttcC' pseudogene is a remnant 17 aa displaced from the original chromosomal ttcA gene. 25 bp encoding four mismatches immediately preceed the 26 bp exact repeat.

An intact version of this region is present in O157:H7 with three genes: a putative AraC-trpe transcriptional regulator Z5000:Q8XDK9(ysaC), a putative permease Z5001:Q8XDK7 and a putative glycosidase Z5002:Q7A9W5(ysaD). Apparently the putative glycosidase was also deleted from K-12.

b4658	EG13008	yghX	pseudogene, dienlactone hydrolase family	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, S9 peptidase family	A ModE-regulated promoter was identified downstream of the yghX gene that could generate an anti-yghX RNA of unknown function; a translation fusion indicated that a small protein encoded by a morA gene might be made from an anti-yghX mRNA, possibly a 63 aa MorA protein initiating at an unusual proline start codon; in vitro translation was not observed (Kurata, 2013). Although some apparent sequence conservation possibly due to yghX was observed in closely related bacteria, stop codons were present within the morA reading frame, indicating morA might not be a protein coding gene despite yielding some expression from a fusion construct; an E. coli ETEC H10407 strain contains a duplication elsewhere of the first 76 bases of the putative morA gene (K.E.R.). An apparent frameshift at codon 141 of yghX' was reconstructed and translated as an X.
b4659	EG12610	yabP	pseudogene, pentapeptide repeats-containing	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, pentapeptide repeats-containing	YabP is a pentapeptide repeat-containing protein of unknown function (NCBI COG1357, Pfam PF00805) with seven copies of a pentapeptide repeat (residues 190-224). The YabP pentapeptide repeat consensus A(T,N)(P,h)DG (h=hydrophobic aa, only the A is invariant) differs somewhat from the published pentapeptide repeat consensuses A(D,N)LXX and (S,T,A,V)(D,N)(L,F)(S,T,R)G (Bateman, 1998; Vetting, 2006). YabP appears to be distantly related to the COG1357 family and apart from the easily identified 7 pentapeptide repeats appears to have degenerated or evolved, possibly acquiring a new function. One N was added after genome coordinate 59052 to hypothetically reverse a yadP' frameshift and reconstruct YabP' with X194 at the frameshift site; the missing base in yabP marked by an N is probably the G present at this location in intact versions of the yabP gene, coding for Gly194. An intact copy of YabP' (UniProt L3L3Z3) with no mismatches other than the X194G is found in the E. coli strain KTE51 genome sequence (Genbank ANUD01000013, locus_tag=A1SA_00636). Alleles of YabP in various other E. coli strains have deletions or insertions of pentapeptide repeats in various phases of the pentapeptide repeat, for example E. coli KTE130 (Genbank ASVN01000010, locus_tag=A1YG_00516) which has a single pentapeptide repeat deletion relative to K-12 and KTE51 at the site of the K-12 frameshift mutation. A PDB structure distantly related to the pentapeptide repeat domain of YabP is PDB 2J8K from N. punctiforme, which forms highly symmetric right-handed quadrilateral beta-helices similar to those found in MfpA from M. tuberculosis, a DNA gyrase inhibitor thought to be a B-form DNA mimic (Hedge, 2005; Vetting, 2007). YadP is restricted to E. coli and several alleles are misannotated as undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (e.g. UniProt H4VRD6) or non-LEE-encoded type III secreted effector (e.g. UniProt E8J137). An expression clone over-producing the last 52 residues of yabP' (labeled as yabQ, the pre-pseudogene reconstruction name for that fragment) has been reported to suppress the slow growth phenotype of an rsgA deletion mutant, but the physiological relevance of this is unclear (Campbell, 2008).
b4660	EG12227	yhiL	pseudogene, DUF4049 family protein	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, DUF4049 family protein; FliA regulated	An apparent frameshift mutation at codon 399 has been reconstructed with an X, which likely was a Lys(K) codon in the original sequence. An intact version of YhiL is present in E. coli O157:H7 as Z4888. The yhiL gene can be transcribed in vitro with sigma28 (FliA) holoenzyme (Yu, 2006).

YfcU' is a member of the FimD outer membrane fimbrial subunit export usher family (Pfam PF00577) with N-terminal (Pfam PF13954) and C-terminal (Pfam PF13953) PapC-like chaperone-pilin complex-binding and pilin assembly domains, respectively. yfcU insertions in E. coli B improve fitness in glucose minimal medium, possibly explaining why yfcU' is mutated in K-12 strains (Schneider, 2000). The first 29 aa of YfcU' are predicted to be a cleavable type I signal peptide. The yfcU' stop codon 579 is translated as X in the reconstruction.

Full length oweE is represented by 313 aa lambda replication protein O homolog c3192 of E. coli CFT073 (NCBI: 26109441). oweS' in the CPS-53 prophage matches the C-terminal 235 aa of intact O protein c3192 and oweE' matches the N-terminal 78 aa of c3192 such that a hypothetical oweE'-oweS' protein fusion would create an intact O-type replication protein almost identical to c3192, indicating that the deletion of the e14 replication/lysis middle region may have contributed genetic material to CPS-53.
b4693	EG14252	aaaE	pseudogene, phage terminase protein A family, e14 prophage	Phage or Prophage Related	Pseudogene, phage terminase protein A family, e14 prophage; C-terminal fragment	Over-expression of the cloned oweE'-aaaE'(ymfN) fusion protein encoded in the K-12 chromosome induces filamentation (Burke, 2013). Full length aaaE is represented by a 577 aa lambda terminase large subunit protein A homolog EcE22_1263 of E. coli E22 (UniProtKB: B3I766). aaaE' is a C-terminal fragment missing the first 200 aa.

b4695	EG14496	ykgT	pseudogene, MobA-related	Null	Pseudogene, MobA/GlmU-related, fragment	YkgT' was previously the N-terminus of an hybrid fusion protein with YagP. An intact E. coli allele has not yet been found but a full length intact 187 aa homolog ERIG_00426 is found in Escherichia fergusonii B253. YkgT' belongs to COG2068, which has an unassigned function; it appears to have evolved an N-terminal GlmU-like homology (COG1207) and kept the C-terminal mostly MobA-derived COG0746. YgfJ is an intact COG2068 paralog to YkgT. The presence of overlapping pseudogenes split from a fusion gene like yagP' and ykgT' indicate a region of identity in the overlapping HK codons; the recombination fusion event happened in the 2 codon interval shared by the two adjacent pseudogenes. The deletion that formed these two pseudogenes created a fusion gene that may be expressed.
b4696	EG11780	yneO	pseudogene, AidA homolog	Null	Pseudogene reconstruction, putative OM autotransporter adhesin; AidA homolog	YneO' is a pseudogene reconstruction of a frameshift that fuses ORFs ydeK and ydeU into a 1773 aa protein with an intact allele in E. coli strain SE11 (NCBI: 209912050). The frameshift reconstruction was to remove one G base after codon 1287 in a string of eight Gs. A TTG start at codon 34 of the previous 1806 aa YneO' is now used since it encodes an N-terminus that has a very good 28 aa Type I signal peptide prediction. The previous start gave a false positive lipoprotein prediction, the Cys was not conserved.
b4697	EG14497	yrdF	pseudogene, conserved protein	Null	Pseudogene, N-terminal fragment	An intact version of the 276 aa YrdF is present in several E. coli strains, e.g. HS (UniProtKB:A8A563). YrdF is belongs to the COG4848/DUF1444/UPF0354/PF07285 family of proteins of unknown function.
b4698	EG31184	mgrR	Null	Null	sRNA affecting sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides; regulated by PhoPQ and Mg(2+)	An mgrR deletion confers a 10-fold increase in Polymyxin B resistance, indicating a probable change in LPS (Moon, 2009). ygdQ and eptB are negatively regulated by the mgrR sRNA (Moon, 2009). The sRNA mgrR and the adjacent converging protein gene yneM are conserved and are also expressed in Salmonella (Sittka, 2008). MgrR was first observed as an sRNA by a signal on microarrays after Hfq precipitation (Zhang, 2003). The 5' end of mgrR sRNA was mapped by RACE; the 3' end is a predicted Rho-independent terminator (Moon, 2009).
b4699	EG31185	fnrS	Null	Null	FNR-activated anaerobic sRNA; mediates negative FNR regulation; Hfq-dependent	FNR activates fnrS transcription anaerobically and then FnrS negatively regulates cydDC, metE, sodA, sodB and other targets, which are translationally repressed indirectly by FNR through FnrS in this manner; FnrS also activates at least one target gene (yhaO) (Boysen, 2010; Durand, 2010). FnrS was previously predicted to be an sRNA based on conservation, but no transcripts are made aerobically so no expression was detected (Wassarman, 2001). Deep sequencing of sRNAs from Salmonella identified the FnrS ortholog STnc580 (Sittka, 2008). The 5' end of FnrS was determined by primer extension and the 3' end is the last U of a predicted rho-independent terminator; the predicted 122 nt size of FnrS was confirmed by Northern blot (Boysen, 2010).
b4700	EG31186	sokE	Null	Null	Antisense sRNA at remnant mokE/hokE locus	Although sokE and hokE are intact, the start of the regulatory peptide gene mokE is missing from this remnant hok/mok locus, so the mokE (and hence hokE) is not expressed and the frame cannot be determined to annotate a pseudogene.
b4701	EG31187	sokX	Null	Null	Antisense sRNA, function unknown	SokX is homologous to the antisense regualtor sok sRNAs at hok loci, but there is no hok toxic peptide at this locus. It is either a remnant locus and hok has been deleted (and thus sokX is likely non-functional), or sokX has acquired an unknown stand-alone function (Kawano, 2005).
b4702	EG14498	mgtL	regulatory leader peptide for mgtA	Null	Regulatory leader peptide for mgtA	The mgtA gene is regulated by a riboswitch responding to Mg(2+) and the MgtL leader peptide responding to intracellular proline levels (Park, 2010).
b4703	EG14499	pmrR	putative membrane-bound BasS regulator	Null	Probable regulator of BasS activity, membrane protein	PmrR has been characterized as a Salmonella membrane protein, conserved in E. coli, that binds to Salmonella PmrB(BasS) and modulates its sensor kinase activity; Salmonella pmrR is transcriptionally regulated by PmrA(BasR) which binds the PmrR promoter (unpublished results of Kato et al. cited in Alix, 2009). PmrR has not been characterized in E. coli and may be a BasS(PmrB) modulator in E. coli.
b4704	EG31188	arrS	Null	Null	Antisense sRNA regulator of gadE and acid resistance; GadE-regulated	Overexpression of ArrS increases acid-resistance and GadE expression (Aiso, 2014). ArrS is encoded on the complementary strand of the gadE 5' UTR; arrS has gadE-dependent transcription in early stationary phase and acid-inducible expression in exponential growth (Aiso, 2011). 
b4705	EG14500	mntS	Mn(2)-response protein, MntR-repressed	Null	MntR-repressed Mn(2)-response protein; MntS overexpression causes Mn(2)-sensitivity	MntS is required for full repression of mntH by MntR and may function by making Mn(2) more available to cells, possibly acting as a manganese chaperone (Waters, 2011). The mntS mRNA was previously thought to be an sRNA (Waters, 2011). The previously annotated yliL(b0816,EG14410) gene partially overlapping mntS is neither conserved nor expressed so it has been removed as a gene (Waters, 2011).
b4706	EG14501	iroK	3-hydroxypropionic acid resistance peptide	Null	3-hydroxypropionic acid resistance peptide	The last 21 amino acids of the hcaR gene has been proposed to be a separate IroK protein whose gene is nested in hcaR that when expressed increases resistance to 3-hydroxypropionic acid independent of HcaT-mediated transport; an apparent RBS in front of iroK is inferred to initiate translation from a clone and when the starting ATG is mutated to TTG the resistance phenotype goes away, however expression of a peptide from the chromosomal iroK locus was not demonstrated (Warnecke, 2011).
b4707	EG31191	esrE	Null	Null	putative sRNA of unknown function	Earlier results identifying an essential sRNA esrE in the ubiJ(yigP) gene could not be reproduced in Salmonella or E. coli; no Salmonella esrE sRNA was detectable by Northern blots or 5' RACE; the ubiJ(yigP) gene is not essential in E. coli and can be deleted; the ubiJ(yigP) deletion strain forms small colonies aerobically and has a reduced growth yield in liquid medium; ubiJ(yigP) is required for ubiquinone but not menaquinone biosynthesis aerobically, but is not required for anaerobic ubiquinone production; the aerobic growth defects of an E. coli ubiJ(yigP) deletion can be complemented by wildtype ubiJ on a plasmid and by a codon-scrambled version of ubiJ that makes the same UbiJ protein sequence, indicating that the growth defect is due to UbiJ protein synthesis, not the esrE sRNA, in contrast to earlier results; a frameshifted version of ubiJ(yigP) on a plasmid failed to complement the growth defect; the C-terminal 50 codons of ubiJ(yigP) are sufficient for complementation of the growth defect and ubiquinone synthesis defect associated with aerobic growth of the ubiJ(yigP) deletion strain; the biochemical functional of UbiJ is unknown but the authors propose that UbiJ could serve as a carrier of the isoprenoid hydrophobic tail prior to the action of monooxygenases and methyltransferases (Aussel, 2013). The 5' and 3' ends of a putative esrE sRNA were mapped within the ubiJ(yigP) gene; the authors reported that the growth defect associated with a (ubiJ)yigP deletion could be complemented with a minimal esrE gene; the authors reported frameshifts do not disrupt the ability of an esrE clone to complement, indicating an RNA not protein product is responsible for the complementation, but this result was later refuted; the 3' end of esrE corresponds to the stop codon of yigP; there is no obvious Rho-independent terminator at the end of esrE (Chen, 2012).
b4708	EG60054	insI2	IS30 transposase	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	IS30 transposase, pseudogene	insI2' in IS30B encodes a C-terminal 57 aa pseudogene fragment missing the first 326 amino acids.
b4709	EG60056	insA9	IS1 transposase A	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	IS1 transposase A	IS1I in crl was added to MG1655 just prior to sequencing and is specific to MG1655(Seq) (Freddolino, 2011).
b4710	EG60057	insB9	IS1 transposase B	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	IS1 transposase B	IS1I in crl was added to MG1655 just prior to sequencing and is specific to MG1655(Seq) (Freddolino, 2011).
b4711	EG60058	insH21	IS5 transposase and trans-activator	IS, phage, Tn; Transposon-related functions; extrachromosomal; transposon related	IS5 transposase	IS5U was inserted upstream of oppA in MG1655 just before the genome was sequenced and is specific to MG1655(Seq) (Freddolino, 2011).
b4712	EG31189	agrA	Null	Null	Inactive antisense sRNA	DinQ is a 27 amino acid UV-inducible toxin that depolarizes the cell membrane, decreases ATP concentration, and affects nucleoid structure after UV exposure; DinQ and the agrB sRNA antitoxin constitute a novel type I-like toxin-antitoxin module that affects the cell response to UV-induced DNA damage; three lines of evidence demonstrate that the agrA sRNA antitoxin can neutralize the DinQ toxin: (1) an agrA deletion mutant is UV-sensitive, grows slowly, and is recessive, while the dinQ agrAB deletion strain is not UV-sensitive and grows normally (agrA single mutants have no phenotype, indicating that the agrA sRNA is inactive), (2) a clone with both agrA and dinQ does not display the UV-sensitivity caused by introducing a dinQ clone alone into wildtype cells, and (3) a dinQ clone cannot be introduced into an agrB mutant strain (Weel-Sneve, 2013). The TERM54 intergenic repeat with transcription termination activity corresponds to the agrA sRNA terminator (Blaisdell, 1993; Rudd, 1999).
b4713	EG31190	agrB	Null	Null	Antisense sRNA antitoxin for the DinQ toxin	DinQ is a 27 amino acid UV-inducible toxin that depolarizes the cell membrane, decreases ATP concentration, and affects nucleoid structure after UV exposure; DinQ and the agrB sRNA antitoxin constitute a novel type I-like toxin-antitoxin module that affects the cell response to UV-induced DNA damage; three lines of evidence demonstrate that the agrA sRNA antitoxin can neutralize the DinQ toxin: (1) an agrA deletion mutant is UV-sensitive, grows slowly, and is recessive, while the dinQ agrAB deletion strain is not UV-sensitive and grows normally (agrA single mutants have no phenotype, indicating that the agrA sRNA is inactive), (2) a clone with both agrA and dinQ does not display the UV-sensitivity caused by introducing a dinQ clone alone into wildtype cells, and (3) a dinQ clone cannot be introduced into an agrB mutant strain (Weel-Sneve, 2013). The TERM55 intergenic repeat with transcription termination activity corresponds to the agrA sRNA terminator (Blaisdell, 1993; Rudd, 1999).
b4714	EG31192	ralA	Null	Null	sRNA antitoxin for RalR toxin	RalA is the sRNA antitoxin for the RalR DNase toxin of the RalRA type I toxin-antitoxin pair; RalR may be involved in DnaA-overproduction-induced dsDNA breaks and the previous RcbA suppression effects may be due to the inhibition of the RalR DNAse due to RalA sRNA overexpression, not YdaC protein overexpression (Guo, 2014). YdaC is a putative protein encoded by a small ORF encoded on the opposite strand as the RalA sRNA and YdaC does appear to encode a conserved DUF1187 family protein of unknown function (Pfam PF06688); until it is determined whether or not RalA, and presumably RalR, are involved in the DnaA-induced dsDNA breaks, and whether or not the putative YdaC protein is involved, rbcA is changed back to ydaC and rbcA is added as a synonym to both ydaC and ralA.
